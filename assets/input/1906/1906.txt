Adbury Lodge, Newbury.
Came to Jephsons. It rained all day. They are kind and Mounteney most affectionate, but they are so desperately unthinking and uninterested in nought that they bore me terribly — alas!
Dined with Jamet and Mr. Streatfield and saw Shaw’s play Major Barbara — did not like it.
Florence: Bernhard received a request for his biography from the Encyclopédie Larousse. Gronau and Placci lunched with him. Then he called on the Serristori.

Went to dressmaker’s with Mrs. Nickerson. Lunched with Reinach. Called on Miss Mintum and the Wilds. Willy carefully informed D.

I left Paris at 8.35.

Bâle to Milan. Horrid journey, but mitigated by sleeping-powder (trional).
Guido met me at 3.10 and took me to Grandi’s and Cavenaghi’s. Dined with him and Frizzoni and Cavenaghi. It is so funny to come from the excitement of the General Election and the sweeping Liberal victory to a nest of quiet Connoisseurs.

He came back at 5 unable to do anything but exclaim, “O Mary, what a Wonderful Woman! What a Sublime Creature!” and so on. The Carlotti, D’A.’s “compagna” seemed to him the sincerest, most candid, most heroic creature he ever encountered. Speriamo.

Wrote home, R. Morton. 
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, Feb. 20, 1906
Rainy.
The fecklessness and incompetence and apathy in practical things of the Hapgoods tends to get on my nerves terribly. I just have not to think about it, but do the next thing to hand. The whole of their Villa-taking, furnishing and providing with servants is on me. But they make up by being so sincere and frank and easy to talk to in the evenings. 
We criticized Fafner’s book for hours, and he was gloriously impersonal.
Wrote Mother, Reinach, Mrs. Thorold, Mrs. K. Browne. 
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, Feb. 21, 1906

I mislaid a page of my ‘Sodoma’, and B.B. burst into a perfectly awful rage, a pitiful spectacle. It must be awful to have a temper like that. It’s awful enough to lose things, but not to compare to such attacks of madness — for it is little else. Poor B.B.

I sat up till 2, talking with Kelly after Logan and I had persuaded him to write a nice note to Miss Weisse. I simply have lost all my sleep over this music — it constantly goes round in me.

He is quite worn out with Mrs. Gardner, who, besides being a Sorceress, is a Vampire. She preserves her marvellous youth by preying upon young men.

Grey. 
Have decided to give Ray £200 a year, and she is delighted. “When I see how other girls are made miserable by their parents, and what a horribly false sense of duty they have to face up, I’m almost afraid to tell them how lucky I am in having not only such a nice family, but such an extraordinarily unselfish and sensible one.”
Called on Neith and the Labouchères. Dora said her Mother in law, speaking of revenge said, C’est un plat qui se mange froid — how awful!! 
Miss Blood came to dine. She confessed to feeling lonely.

Middling.
Christina Bremner. 
Worked. Christina arrived (an hour late) and I met her. We did some shopping. 
Placci came to tea and read us the preface of his new book on “artistic automobiling”. It wasn’t bad.
Bernhard is getting more encouraged about his book. It is crammed full of ideas. 
Mr. Sargant came to dine, and brought a Keats for which he has done the woodcuts which are pretty good. 
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, Dec. 25, 1906
Rainy.
Talked with Christina and worked. 
After lunch I called on Mrs. Ross, whom I found desolating, and poor Miss Erichsen, who has grown hideous with Gravis disease. 
Then I went to participate at the Christmas tree at the Hapgoods. Miss Blood was there, and drove me home. 
In the evening Bernhard and I dined with the Labouchères. I sat by Major Chapman, a fearful bore. Labby was amusing afterwards, and Algar charming as usual. 
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, Dec. 26, 1906
Fine, warm, then rain.
A heavenly morning! Sorted photographs with B.B.
After lunch walked to the Gamberaia with B.B. and Christina, through the woods. Found Miss Erichsen there, and Hutchins came in. Drove back with Miss E. and called on Mrs. Ross. 
Found Don Guido here, with whom we chatted all the evening. He is so nice, but conversationally dull.

$$HEADER$$_Friday, Dec. 28, 1906
Damp. 
Christina.
Called on Mrs. Ross and Neith and Fafner walked back with me.

[p148]

Glorious. Such a day! And we spent the afternoon at poor Horne’s, who has turned his house into a dreary rubbish-shop. He is the born collector, and lives in utter discomfort, with all his objets piled around him — the absolute negation of beauty and dignity. 
Called also on the Serristori,and in the evening on Lina at Poggio.
