People coming to I Tatti
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, September 24, 1930
	We got back from the Consuma bring with us Theron Damon from Constantinople
who had been spending some days with us. He belongs to the genial class known
in New England as “Loafers”, unable to stick to anything as go deeply into things,
but always amiable and willing and good company.
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, September 25, 1930
	Naima Löfroth came up, just back from Sweden. Wild and unconversational as ever.
$$HEADER$$_Sunday, September 28, 1930
	Mrs. Lanier and Mr. and Mrs. Allyn Cox arrived from Venice. The former is considerably decayed since we saw her last 3 years ago, and her little mind seems to run round and round in a narrower circle than ever – about a yard from her own person is its 
[p6]
utmost range. Whithin those limits it cuts ungraceful capers. She loves more than anything else to recount how she got the better of this and that person. She used to be lovely to look at but is now bloated and pale and unhealthy-looking. She told me, among other things, about the masses of expensive
lace she has brought for her sheets and pillows and towels and table clothes. These laces have to unseen whenever the things one sent to the wash! “Conspicuous expenditure” a kind for us to have such a person visiting here. Her tiny, nervous lap day is a horror. 
	Allyn Cox is a little fatter, but otherwise much the same. Artistically he 
attained his majority very early, and as it brings him success there is little hope of growth. 
	Jill Cox is tall, pale, slender with 
[p7]
brown-coloured hair and sharp prudish
features. We could not discover any particular spark of intelligence in her, except a look 
sometimes in her legs. 
$$HEADER$$_Monday, September 30, 1930
	Mrs. Lanier brought up her brother, Jim, and his turn-soul (?), Mr. Paul Frerejean, and a young Dame, countess Blücher-Altona, to tea. Mr. Lanier has an even more restricted mind than his sister, but I think more aimable. He has a house in a rose-garden in Provence near Les Beaux and seems to be happy in his homosexual college. Frerejean has the suavity and culture of the best of his type.
The young Dame seemed very wooden.
	Later Edith Wharton and Gilliard Lapsley arrived by motor from Salsomaggiore, with two Pekinese.
[p8]
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 1, 1930
	Ruth Wolf, enormously smellowed and improved by misfortune and failure, came to lunch – now a really fascinating man. Also a Graf Erbach Fürstenan and his spouse came. He looked like a coarsely painted Tintoretto. He writes on Manuscripts of the XIII Century. She talks on domestic matters. I thought I should die of sleepiness!
	In the evening Cecil Pinsent and Ruth Draper came to dine. The latter
gave us the new “piece”, “Three Women”, and a much longer and more profound thing that she has so far done. Very remarkable. She grows handsomer and handsomer, as intelligence and success touch her features. Mrs. Lanier’s face is going exactly the
opposite way.
[p9]
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 2, 1930
	Mrs. Lanier and Mr. “Pinches” left in the morning. Kenneth and Jane Clark spent the day and were very agreeable. To dinner came the Allys Coxes (she looked positively lovely!) and Mrs. Murphy, Geoffrey’s friend, granddaughter of the American painter, W. Hunt. She seemed enthusiastic and intense, yet was agreeable. But BB found the enthusiasm very uninstructed. 
$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 3, 1930
	I had my first treatment for nevritis at the Munari clinic. The ether in the compound made me too seasick to get up all day. Logan arrived at 5 and drank tea in my room.
$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 4, 1930
	Baroness Osten-Sachen arrived in the morning. She seems to have got rather petrified but it is awkard with Logan and Mrs. Wharton absorbing all the conversation, and turning it on subject she knows nothing of. And her 
[p10]
English has grown a bit rusty too. I am distressed at the situation.
	In the afternoon Logan and I called on Strong and Santayana, and Lapsley left.
It seems he is a fervent High Churchman. Santayana scarcely knew him at Harvard,
and when Logan said “You belonged to the hard-boiled set, and he must have been 
one of the soft-boiled ones”, Santayana said “He isn’t boiled at all”.
$$HEADER$$_Saturday [sic], October 5, 1930
	Ugo Ojetti came to lunch and was very agreeable and amusing.
In the afternoon there came Hon. Miss George Keppel, Lady Cowley, Mrs. Ruby Lindsay, Mr. Jean Gaigneron, Mrs. Trefusis, Mr. and Mrs. Allyn Cox, Miss Keppel said her sister had come home to roost, for Sir Arthur Colefax has fallen desperately in love with her.
[p11]
Logan said Lady Cowley Was very clever, Mrs. Lindsay is an ex-beauty, still beautiful, and M. Gaigneron, blond and blend, seemed intelligent and agreeable.
$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 5, 1930
	I quite forget.
$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 6, 1930
	Carlo Placci came to dine, but was rather boring, as he always is when he comes back from his summer visits to the Great.
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 7, 1930
	BB and Edith and I went to Torre Acona and saw the park. There we spoke to the owner, Contessa Padova, a lively lady of the Maria Papafava, Pasolini type, and her son-in-law Tenente Gioia, who was out hunting mushrooms with the full paraphrenalia of the chase
	Baroness Osten-Sachen left. 
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 8, 1930
	Edith, Nicky and BB got off to La Foce to lunch, and Montepulciano to sleep.
John Brown from Zurich came to lunch and to study in the Library, a sissy type, not very promising, but a nice youth. I like the mother better than any of the children.   
[p12]
$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 10, 1930
	Sir Robert and Lady Crey came to lunch. Not much in it for us. A Mrs. De Wett Verner came to tea – a niece of my old friend, Eva Mc Laren. Still less in it. She has a daughter who is a sculptress in Paris.
	BB and Edith and Nicky returned from their trips.
$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 11, 1930
	Called for Carlo Placci after my Munari treatment (for nevritis). He came to stay for 2 days. In the afternoon Logan and I called on Nellie Mackay at the Villa Frosino, San Domenico. She was as ‘intense’ and neurotic as ever, and her husband was unnaturally dull. They had a French Countess of sorts staying with him, privately a mistress or ex-mistress of his, an insignificant, off-colour sort of person.
$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 12, 1930
	Ugo Ojetti came to lunch. He wants Edith to give him a short story for Dedalo.
Walked from Salaiuoli. Most lovely.
$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 13, 1930
	Edith left and Sir Robert K.C.M. and Lady Gregg (Julia) came. I drove them to S. Martino alle Palme and came home to 
[p13]
to find that De Marinis had brought Benedetto Croce to tea. Moravia also had stayed in from lunch. Croce was most interesting, as always, but I was so utterly tired (for the Greggs did not respond enliveningly to the beauty I showed them), that I finally had to excuse myself and creep off to rest. Gregg talked interestingly about his last post, Romania. He said that Antoine Bibesco was a despicable cabotin and his wife (Asquith’s daughter) little better.
King Carol is a Worm.
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 14, 1930
	Friedländer of the Berlin Museum came to lunch, a quiet, able, agreeable man.
Afterwards his friends, frau and Doktor P[erles] came and stayed endlessly looking at the collection. She is a very sub. Rubens plus German type, but no doubt pleasing to the Herr Geheimath Friedländer. He, by the way, said he was ready to collaborate with me in a list of “Sacred” pictures, he doing the early Flemish and Germans, I, the Italians. Kenneth Clark and Jane arrived. He is ill and went at once to bed.
[p14]
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, October 15, 1930
	Mr. and Mrs. Archie Mackay and Mme de Saint Blancard (?) came to lunch. As Alda said, you don’t meet such people! The French lady complained heavily of people punching her (but not today) under the table, Nellie indulged in high-flown metaphysical sentiment, and her husband bored us all. Late as Mme Serristori and Sophie Bossi-Pucci came to tea, the latter bringing her 3 children (one not yet born). She seemed very distraite, perhaps her condition absorbed her. 
  Jane came down for tea.
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 16, 1930
	I had my Day in Bed (one of them), and thoroughly enjoyed it, reading Freud’s last book: “Civilization and some of its Discontents” (reasonable, wise, noble) and “Shutters of Snow” a madhouse book, very vivid. Edmund Houghton came with his stereoscopic views of their trips in India, and Pellegrina.
$$HEADER$$_Friday, October 17, 1930
	Day in bed, but up to see Percy Lubbock at dinner. He made a charming impression of detached and humorous observation and of shrewd kindness upon us all.
[p15]
$$HEADER$$_Saturday, October 18, 1930
	Corrected BB’s “Homeless Pictures” article till Mr. and Mrs. Hammer came to lunch. I wish I liked them more. We went down to see the new car.
Barbara writes, a propos of the music in the Chapel of New College… “It was too much for a poor creature who hasn’t been to Church for 4 years! But I think it’s one of the greatest pleasures in life to feel that a thing is too beautiful to be borne one second longer and yet if it stops you will be heartbroken”    
	Naima came for the weekend. 
$$HEADER$$_Sunday, October 19, 1930
	Carlo Placci came to lunch bursting with “important secret information”, which of course turned out to be nothing at all. I thought BB was too hard on him, but he was very good natured, and there was no real quarrel. At lunch Logan uttered the interesting technical observation that novellists [sic] often convey and individualize character by reproducing actual tricks of speech, but BB was dreadfully contentious, and when he was proved wrong said “It hasn’t the slightest interest”. I suppose it is his digestion! Alda and Bertie came to dine. Jane Clark was rather ill in the night.
[p16]
$$HEADER$$_Monday, October 20, 1930
	Logan left at two.
Tuesday – Monday, October 21-27, 1930, Siena
	We had a truly enchanting week in Siena, sight and landscape seeing. Alda came with us, but returned to Florence on Saturday when we went with the Superintendent ofart at San Geminiano to see his improvements there (Peleo Bac[c]i).
  One day we drove to Castagneto del Bosco and lunched with De Biondis. We met our old Mrs. Godfroy, who spends her life dancing, and her Sec.? Mr. Whitaker. Also a rather deaf brother of Biondis.
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, October 28, 1930
	Nelly Mackay came to lunch and was larmoyante and sentimental, and yet rather appealing. Vavalà came for the day and have a gap at the Lists.
Houghton and the Waterfields came to tea, and a Mrs. Virginia (Francis) Peabody from Cambridge to dine, an attractive cultivated young widow. Fausto knocked BB down and hurt his sciatic nerve so that he failed and had to go to bed.
[p17]
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, October 30, 1930
	Was X-rayed to see (is possible) what cause my nevritis.
Lina Waterfield and Carlo Placci came to lunch, but I was too tired to enjoy 
the talk.
Friday-Saturday, October-November 31-1, 1930
	Trying to rest in bed, but BB kept coming in and saying it was bad for me to stay in bed, so at last I got up Friday afternoon and had tea with Edmund Houghton and Vavalà and Naima. Read “My Mortal Enemy” (by Willa Cather) aloud is the evening.
$$HEADER$$_Sunday, November 2, 1930
	Edmund and Mary Houghton came to lunch. Tho’ they are over 70, they are going 3^ class to Java, plucky people! They stayed to dine with Naima while BB and I went to 
[p18]
dine at the Consul’s to meet Mr. and Mrs. (Julia Marlowe) Sothern, charming personalities. The rest of the guests, Mrs. Matteini, Mr. Cooksaw, the Struisons, were just people.
$$HEADER$$_Monday, November 3, 1930
	Nesta de Robeck came to lunch, a dear, but a trifle too eager in agreeing with me. She sees the Origo situation just as we do, also the character of Lady Sybil, but BB is more lenient to the latter. I called on the Struisons. I think it is (for us) a cul de sac.
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, November 4, 1930
	I had my tiresome nevritis treatment. Ugo Ojetti, Sua Eccellenza, came to lunch, very pleased with his election to the Academy and his visit to the King at San Rossore. I feel very seasick from the ether in my ointment and went to bed, and then the Countess Rosales found me. I liked her better than I used to. John Walker 8°, BB’s new Disciple, came to tea. He will be nicer when he is older and some of the American paints is washed off him. His laugh is painful. But he seems intelligent and fun and agreeable.
[p19]
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, November 5, 1930
	Mrs. And Miss Hermann came to lunch. The daughter was very enthusiastic, and so was a Freulein Fülterer who came and photographed our Gagini statue. John Walker and his friend, Eugene Williams, an upper-faced lady, came to lunch, had a walk with BB, and finally Lucy Donelly and Edith Frick came to tea and to stay for 2 or 3 nights. 
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, November 6, 1930
	Lucy and Edith staying- Vavalà and Walker to lunch; the Waterfield and Cecil Pinsent to dine.
$$HEADER$$_Friday, November 7, 1930

She said that a widespread Roman poster for table-silver represented 3 men running, one carrying a fork, one a spoon and one a knife. They call it La Marcia su Roma!
[p22]
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, December 9, 1930
	For a wonder, no-one outside the house…Morra read to us.
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, December 10, 1930
	Pancrazi and his sister came to lunch, and by our error, mistaking
the day. Prof. and Mrs. Hart from Berkeley College. He is “English Literature”, she is
commonplace. Ojetti came to tea and Miss Wiskermann.     
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, December 11, 1930
	Young Brown (John) from Zurich came to tea and stayed till 7, thrilled first by BB’s and then my talk about art. At least he seemed so.
$$HEADER$$_Friday, December 12, 1930
	No one to lunch, for a wonder and BB called on Strong to avoid my pushing visits, whom I hope never to see again. One was a Miss Spencer from Cambridge Mass. whom I have pointedly avoided, but this time I let her come, thinking she was someone else. A horrid woman. The 
[p23]
others were nice little France von Millizen, who had the tactlessness to bring her (paid?) hostess, a Mrs. Earle, one of the last people I want to know. Both ladies said: “Now that we know you, dear Mrs. Berenson, you will let us come again, won’t you? The dead faintlessness of such acquaintances!
Percy Lubbock came to dine, but it wasn’t easy going. He, though, is worthwhile.
$$HEADER$$_Friday [sic] [Saturday], December 13, 1930
	Nicky’s 43rd birthday. Cora came to lunch. The Maresciallo of Fiesole called to ask if, Alys was really my sister and how long she meant to stay!  Naima came for the night. She leaves for Stockholm tomorrow, and Lina arrived unexpectedly from Aulla.

[p24]
$$HEADER$$_Monday, December 15, 1930
	Vavalà came up to stay 2 nights, hoping to break the evil spell of her illness. Also Miss Wiskermann, who disguises perhaps an intelligent person by a mask of giggling.
She and Lina and Morra went to a concert. BB and Nicky left for Hyères.
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, December 16, 1930
	The same. Called on Mrs. Clark at Poggio Gherardo, and tasted the Vermouth Lina spent the day making. Lina told us some of her 7 – ex experiences in the evening. She was most entertainy. Barbara arrived at midnight, pretty tired from a week wild sociability in London.
[p25]
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, January 20, 1931
	With BB away, I lost the desire to record our days. I had a splendid long visit fromAlys, from Karin and her children, from Christopher and Barbara and their father
(Ray stayed at home to get a new set of teeth and finish her book on Mrs. Fawcett).
We had great doing, 2 Fairy dress parties. Barbara and I went to Aulla and Lerici for 3 days, Alys and Olivier and Ann to Aulla for a night. The 4 Waterfields and their nice pupil, Peggy Macdonnell came and stayed and meet with me.
	At last I had to say goodbye to all my beloved guests. By that time Senda Abbot had come, and presently van Rensselaer Lee. We had the Kennedys and Vavalà to dine
and a Mrs. Stern to lunch.
[p26]
Today Lina came to tea, and Frau Lene Schneider-Kainer, fresh from Thibet and Siam and China. Very interesting. She made studies in the Thibetan Monastries, and special studies of the women of the East.
Lee is still here. Senda stays till we go to Africa. Lovely to have BB and darling Nicky at home again!
