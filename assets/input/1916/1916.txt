  Wasted a good deal of time (if it is waste) walking with Geoffrey. I hope it clears his mind and fortifies him: but I see him doomed to great unhappiness in the affair in which he is embarked. However, probably even Something with an unhappy ending is better than Nothing, for the Young.   
  We went with Lina and Gordon and Julia to the Actons’ children’s party - a badly managed affair with too many vulgar flirting Florentines at it, crowding out the children.  
  Walter Dowdeswell came to dine and was very clownish and amusing, telling ghost stories and reciting comic poems.

  I went down to see Miss Priestly at her hospital. I saw a man whose jaw and tongue had been shot off, and others who have lost limbs, especially from frost-bite. I took there some Fels Naptha soap, the best cleaning soap there is.
  Then I called for Miss Cochrane and brought her up to lunch. She has some sort of spiritistic crank at the back up her head, the old goose. I took her to Mrs. Ross. 
  B.B and Naima took a walk and Geoffrey spent the day with M.M., who seems a nicer person than she did at first. 
  Julia had a day in bed, as it was her first monthly time, poor child.

  De Nicola came to see B.B. Geoffrey and I had a morning walk in the laghetto, an exceptional affair, because of the exceptional day. 
  De Nicola stayed to lunch. He was at the Front at Plava,but lacked all power to tell about anything. 
  I motored him down and Geoffrey. We picked up Marcella Michela and I took them towards Bagni a Ripoli and started them on a walk — much better for them there stuffing indoors. She looked very beautiful and I felt drawn to her. I think if I were in Geoffrey’s place my head would be turned, but he seems to keep his balance miraculously. Long may it last.

  Capt. Perry came to tea, and Mr. and Mrs. Trench, Mr. Dumonts, the boys, and Lina to dinner.

  Geoffrey decided to take things lightly in spite of the earnest and soulful vocabulary. He is certainly happier and more contented. Before this came he found living in Florence rather stale. He had Marcella Michela to tea. 
  Julia and Maeve Trench and Gordon played in the Laghetto, while B.B and Lina and I had a splendid walk on the hill. Signora Bozzelli and her sweet little daughter Miriam were here when we came back, and later her lover, Guido Ferrando, came in. She is intense and inexpressive. 
  B.B wrote an article on a picture in Detroit by Giovanni Paolo di Agostini. Rather dull, needs rewriting.

  Shopped with Lina and the children for the Party. I hate all the fuss, yet do not feel it is an undesirable thing in itself. Young people rouse you.   
  Had a long walk with Geoffrey, who is (of course) drifting in and in. He now has “absolute confidence in her purity and innocence and sincerity”- of course he may be right, but I cannot believe it of a girl grown to 26 in such surroundings, with such recklessness, so self-absorbed— and an Italian. It is fantastic. But it is useless to contradict him. I should only make him hate me, and probably accelerate the course of things by opposition. Besides, I may be wrong. I hope I am. But I see a very painful tragedy ahead. However, being a Cassandra is a poor trade, and youth faces many dangers without going under. Only Geoffrey has been so unlucky before, though full of beautiful dreams and confidence. I am very anxious.

However it went off very well. Iris and Gordon spent the night. 
  Geoffrey and I went down to the opera “Norma,” with Marcella and her rather sad and faded looking mother (a Fabbricotti) and Byba. The 2 girls looked very beautiful and very “foreign.” It was like a page out of a novel by Ouida. Marcella is certainly very beautiful, vivid, brilliant, and vital. I have seldom seen (outside of Gladys) a girl with more promise. But her eyes are hard, and she looks like a bird of prey — a beautiful one, but frightening — Very selfwilled and self-absorbed, but awfully interesting. Geoffrey may think himself lucky, unless he gets really in love.

  Went on correcting B.B.’s dull and formless and slovenly articles. I hate it worse than anything; his writing is a real insult. They are much worse than his letters. But all clouds rolled away (not war cloud) by a glorious walk which he and I and Naima and Geoffrey took to Bagazzano, under a crystal clear sky, with a bracing wind. Geoffrey talked about M. all the way. It is some consolation in their many absences, for she is by no means free to go to see him even on her non-hospital days.

  Geoffrey on the unending theme, but he is always subtle, amusing, kind and profound. He really isn’t much in love, though she’s awfully nice. Curious how these things go.

  Julia lunched with the Arbuthnots, and I went to get her, after having had a long and beautiful walk with B.B, back from “The Tree” to Fiesole. He said he had tried to help Sybil about her appalling self-absorbition, but she spends so much time and ingenuity proving to him that she isn’t self-absorbed, that he is bored and disgusted with the whole thing. She said that he made her afraid of him, she could care so much more for him and give him so much more if it weren’t for that - and he nearly cried out “You give me too much already!”

  We went to the National Gallery and saw Mrs. Glenny who was copying a picture - I hadn’t seen her since 13 years ago when we stayed with her in Buffalo. She was then rich and beautiful and strong and surrounded by friends. She is now poor, her fat face all pulled out of shape by paralysis, husband, and lovely daughter Alice dead, living with the other daughter and a singing teacher in lodgings - It was ghostly to see her.

  Alys and I, after shopping for the girls, called on Mildred Minturn Scott to see Geoffrey’s mother. Mildred’s hair had just been dyed a vivid copper.

Hot incense very strong, mélange of cheap Eastern things, good silver and flowers, white furs, pictures of nude or intense females everywhere. 
  She has an incorrigible “way-back.” American twang, a good-natured, warm manners, is no longer pretty, and not at all tidy. 
  The house was crowded and not dainty, all except the best bedroom (a circular Empire one) where she said Yoï made her decision to never away from her husband. 
  The Tylers and Ch. Du Bos came here to tea. 
  Byba wrote to Geoffrey that Nikky was coming back this Spring. Fearful upset, for the Marcella business is going ahead and he hates the idea of giving it up. If Nikky had only waited a year -“or 18 months.” But he mustn’t spoil his future. He is miserable.

Monsieur, 
Excusez la liberté que je prends de vous adresser cette lettre étrange. Voici le fait: j’ai 42 ans, je suis père de 4 enfants. J’aime ma femme qui m’adore, les circonstances ont voulu que je sois resté en relations quotidiennes avec une jeune fille qu’insensiblement je suis arrivé à aimer et qui m’aime. Ces relations, longtemps chastes, auraient pu changer si je n’étais devenue impuissant et cette impuissance qui se n’était jamais manifesté est désormais égale à l’égard de ma femme légitime et de celle qui, par scrupule d’abord, n’est jamais devenue ma maitresse.
  Je me suis adressé à un médecin spécialiste (dont par discrétion je tairai le nom et que je connaissais nullement) et, après un échange de correspondances nombreuse, il termine nos relation par la lettre suivante dont je vous prie d’excuser les termes, pas trop flatteuses, dont je suis gratifié: 
  « Cher Monsieur, intelligent et cultivé, intéressant et indécis. Les circonstances actuelles (je viens d’être mobilisé) sont si peu favorables, vous avez un si grand besoin à être documenté pour que votre documentation entraine votre conviction. Factum essentiel au succès, que je préfère y senonar. Plus tard si on peut encore faire quelque chose, ma bonne volonté vous reste acquise. 
  Avec regrets, je garderai un très bon souvenir de vous…. »

  Mon cher ami, 
  Tous ce que tu m’écris à propos de Nicky n’a rien à faire avec mon silence de jours passés…Byba ne m’a pas parlé d’elle dernièrement : je lui ai demandé si elle avait reçu des nouvelles : le peu que nous l’avons nommée ce n’était pas en rapport à toi. 
Il est vrai que parfois, joking, Byba m’a dit que tu avais un penchant pour elle ce que je trouvais tout à fait naturel (j’aime bien Nicky et je la trouve charmante) mais elle n’a jamais insisté excessivement là-dessus. 
  Geoffrey ce n’est pas gentil à toi d’avoir pensé à moi comme tu l’ai fait. Tu sais bien que je n’ai aucun droit sur toi ni sur ta vie si en n’est un droit d’honnête amitié mêlé à un sentiment réel et profonde d’appréciation mutuelle. 
  Pourquoi ne pas t’écrire, même en sachant que tu l’aimerais ? Est-ce que ce jour ne viendra pas ? Est-ce-que ce jour notre amitié devrait finir ? A quoi bon alas ? Elle, ou une autre, je sens que ton mariage n’est pas loin, et je tache de me faire une petite place prés de toi, une petite place aime qui pourra, avec un peu de 
[p61]
travail, être conservée. Je te rends, et tu le sais bien, une sincérité absolue, et je te remercie de tout ce que tu dis de Nicky. Si elle pourra faire ton bonheur, je serai heureuse moi-même. Je comprends parfaitement to situation présent et tes rapport avec elle. Je ne veux pas que la pensée de moi puisse te gêner d’aucune façon. Je ne suis pas mêlée à ta vie, mais à coté de ta vie – nous l’avons voulu ainsi, il est donc inutile que tu eu souffrir sans raison. Me trouves-tu trop raisonnable ? Mon ami, il faut faire le possible per andare avanti - without rocks, as you say. 
  J’ai vu tant de choses laides dans ma vie, et même dernièrement, que j’ai soif de clarté, de anti mis-understanding. Je n’aurai plus énergie pour me travailler une amitié scabreuse et compliquée. 
  Je cherche le simple que et ce n’est qu’a travers le simple que l’on touche en profond. Ne crois-tu pas ? Alors c’est entendu, cher ami. Si tu la … si ta conviction se fera qu’elle est ta femme, tu l’aimera sans 
[p62]
contrainte, et il n’y aura pas besoin de me le cacher. C’est bon de voir les gens heureux, et les amis surtout. Tout cela ne me donne pas de tristesse, je te le dis avec sincérité. Au fond, je n’ai pas le sens de la possession, qui obsède tout le monde, je suis très impersonnelle, et à cause de cela, ni avide, ni jalouse. Je puis souffrir énormément, mais par ces raisons bien différents et plus directes. Je crois aussi que tu as besoin d’une vie ayant une base, et je sais que tu ferais du mariage la chose la meilleure et le plus esthétique possible. Il-y-a quelque chose d’énorme, d’immense et de manqué entre nous deux, qui n’est pas de notre faute et qui me donne parfois une nostalgie profonde. Les plus beaux amours sont ceux qui ne sont pas nés, ils conservent une puissance cachée et nuptieuse qui émane des très loin des arômes captivants. Nous sommes quelques lignes d’une grande ébranche on a parfois cette impression en regardant les esquisses des grands artistes – on y voit la semence de chefs d’œuvres qui n’eut jamais vu la lumière. 
[p63]
  Quant à moi, ce n’est pas vrai que le mariage me soit a sheer necessity : même vu de coté de la liberté de l’action ma liberté se fait de plus en plus intérieure ; plus ma monde intérieur …et , s’élargit, moins l’extérieur m’est sensible et nécessaire. Tu as toujours exagéré un peu, et pris à la lettre tout ce que j’ai dit à propos du mariage. Il est vrai qu’un ménage me serait presque insupportable, parce que la vie matérielle y aurait une prépondérance suffoquante (sic) [suffocante], et je ne suis pas faite par la lutte du pot-au-feu, ni par empanacher la misère pour le public. Mais la nécessité du mariage est chez moi réduite au minimum – c’est une appendice à ma vie – ma vie est complète en elle-même –j’aurais besoin d’une expansion générale or le mariage est tout qu’il y a de moins générale de plus fixe et de plus systématique. Le mariage ne m’offre donc encore attraction particulière. Si j’étais une femme sensuelle le mariage ne serait encore pas nécessaire. Je n’ai jamais compris pourquoi les hommes ont cette idée de vouloir m’épouser 
[p64]
en disant que je serais une femme idéal, et quelque uns une mère merveilleuse ( !). je vois que je puis peut être en dehors de ces deux choses, que j’accomplirais avec conscience mais avec peu d’enthousiasme, parfois avec beaucoup d’ennui. Je ne me sens pas faite par certains bonheurs, qui peut être sont très grands quoique très partagés. Je me sens parfois excitée, lointaine, pleine d’une grandeur informe et stupide qui regarde le bonheur d’autrui sans pouvoir y toucher. Je suis un être intérmédiane spirituellement, analytique, contemplatif mobile et géneralisateur, la femme s’y perd en ne gardant que la sensibilité et l’esprit d’intuition. 
  Ne te fais donc aucune idée sur la possibilité de ma souffrance ou de ma joie personnelle. Je me sens des essences infinies qui accourant toujours due rendre la balance. 
  Cher ami, c’est déjà si extraordinaire de pouvoir se parler ainsi, sans arrière-pensée de se montre dans la parfaite nudité de notre pensée, qu’il m’en revient une sorte de bonheur complet une paix et une beauté intérieur 
[p65]
indicibles. Peut-être rien ne vous embellit autant que cette confiance de l’âme qui parle… l ’ âme qui ne parle jamais, qui fait parler l’opportunité pour elle, elle parle enfin avec sa bouche parfaite, et sa parole si rare rassemble à un chant qui caresse tout l’ être engourdi…… 
  Adieu mon bon, je t’ai écrit avant de me lever, car je voulais répondre immédiatement à ta dernière lettre.
  A very remarkable letter, although on reading it sounds a little unreal or like a pretty exercise on a theme. She is lining up to an idea she has of herself, a sort of spiritual pose.

Germany for her is the Land of Promise, the model and only hope of the future. She said England was on its last leg financially and was cited “The Union of Democratic Control” as proof that it was all falling to pieces. What a fool Adrian is to be in such a society.

  Windy and damp but a little sunshine 
  Great buzz from Geoffrey over Cecil’s visit, as it would perhaps hinder him from seeing Marcella before she goes to Spain, if he waited for Cecil in Paris. He thinks it is my fault, but I had heard nothing of his plans since I left, and furthermore could not alter the date, as it is fixed by Cecil meeting Strong at Genoa on the 25th. While I really believe it is poison to him to go on with Marcella, whose awesome anabaptism makes her august and admirable but very dangerous, I do sympathize with young blood that needs its sfogo. 
  So without saying a word about it to Cecil, I hope I managed for him to meet Geoffrey at Turin instead of Paris. Marcella on her side made a muddle, writing to me that she could not come up till the end of next week, meaning this week. And now I have arranged all sorts of conflicting things for this weekend.

In the Flanders’ offensive last October a German General was wounded and as his division had to retreat…., he was left behind lying in a field between the oncoming English and the Germans who had reformed to shoot. A terrific storm of bullets rattled over him, into the midst of which a young English officer ran and picked up the General and brought him back to the German lines, and handed him over to the 2nd officer. This man (though a Bosch) was so moved that he snatched off his Iron Cross and pinned it into breast of the Englishman, who then walked quickly back to his own side. Not a shot was fired for half an hour after.

  Marcella Michela came up at 5, after I had had Flora Priestley all day. She is a dear but a great talker—I am however attached to her, which seldom happens to me with talkers. Marcella “performed” very brilliantly in the evening. We laughed and greatly enjoyed it, yet were somewhat chagrined that she wouldn’t pay the slightest attention to anything we said! Her use of language is delightful, and she observes characteristic and significant things with much wit, though not exactly humor. She is a gifted creature. 
  Poor little Miss Cohen also came to call. Marcella spoke of both Geoffrey and Marchesi as prétendants and mimicked their probable attitude towards each other. She also said she would be furiously jealous and couldn’t possibly share a man with another woman - unless it was Kitty Bosco.

  Marcella “performed” very brilliantly for me alone in the morning, telling about her brother-in-law’s experiences as commander of an Italian sub-marine. 
  She also performed at lunch for the benefit of Dr. Crescenzi, whom I invited to get as a husband for Naima, who is so convinced by my argument against her lonely life that she would like to marry him. Her intentions being strictly honorable, she is afraid to seem forward and ask him to come and see her. So I sent him some Hospital supplies (from America), and on the strength of it invited him to come up. A really nice man, good and clever and strong. She would be lucky. He took him to call on Mrs. Ross later. 
  Marcella had her young Roman sailor friend, Capitano Tuttino, who spent the afternoon with her, the one she wrote so blandly to Geoffrey about as being like a nice younger brother. He is 28 and is clearly in love with her and if

 she doesn’t know if she is stupid. They walked together while BB and I entertained Frizzoni. When the latter and the Capitano went down in the motor, BB and I were so tired we just crept off by ourselves. 
  In the evening, Marcella, tired too, perhaps, was more like a human being, and BB liked her very much. I quite loved her, though I still feel something very strange about her, and especially about her relations with men. Then she dyes her hair, which is very strange for a young girl, and her eyes are hard and glittering. But there’s something else simple and good and very noble in her.

It is really a horrid way to act, and she deserves to suffer. Unfortunately if she suffers, then he will be drawn in by the human and nice side of him.

She said he didn’t “understand” and she was awfully grieved, but admitted she had gone almost straight from yesterday’s painful interview to pass the evening with one of her young men friends.

  We went in to see Horne, who is much worse. He held Bernard’s hand and said he had been for days trying to recall the saying “the falling out of faithful friends is love’s renewing”. He begged Bernard to go on being friends with him, and when Bernard said he would, he said “this is a moment of real happiness for me”.

  Poor Horne died at 2 o’clock last night, peacefully. Santina, his servant, said that soon before he died he reached out and grasped an imaginary hand and patted it. She thought it was Bernard’s. We were the only people he saw yesterday. It meant a great deal to him to be reconciled with B.B. We were just in time - and how fortunate I got him to make his will.

  B.B. and I, with Herbert Trench went to Horne’s funeral at the Protestant Cemetery.
L’assistance was composed of “Sods” and dealers, very typical of one side of the poor fellow’s life. 
  Trench was full of a new “great” poem he had just composed, and Loeser was heard to say “when I marry again, I shall marry a deaf-mute”. 
  No one wept, no one cared as much as I did. I think, unless it was that unspeakable little mini Collingwood Gee. It seemed rather tragic, but at least he is no longer suffering.  
  Geoffrey took Miss Hulton a walk in the Laghetto. 
  The Marainis and Prince Paul joined on party of 6 at dinner. Nello was furiously jealousy, and Yoï whispered to Geoffrey that he had made her an awful scene.

  Alys wired that she had got safely to England, not being torpedoed on the Atlantic, and that Barbara was “enchanting”. That I will believe, and I loved to read it.
  Geoffrey received Marcella for one of her determined and lengthy tête-a-tête, but she was nicer this time, and I read Italian poetry with him, and was intelligent and __, instead of spending all her time spooning. He liked it better, for his method of lovemaking is like the Snark’s method of Charity: “She collects but she does not subscribe”. 
  He came back very pleased. But I can see that both of them are heading for a stormy “affair” all the same, I hope it will keep off till I go to America, for I don’t like the young woman, and I feel sure she will make Geoffrey unhappy. But perhaps even unhappiness is better than ‘nothing doing.’

  Mme Luchaire was rather full of Marcella’s monstrous lies.

 Misgiving 
  We were talking of people, and a name familiar to us all was mentioned. We paused and looked at each other; then soon by means of anecdotes and clever touches, that personality was reconstructed in our conversation. It seemed to appear before us, large, pink and life-like, and gives a comic sketch of itself with appropriate poses. 
  “Of course”, I said to myself, “this sort of thing never happens to me”. For the notion was quite unthinkable, the notion I mean of my own image, so clear to me and strange and sacred, caught like this defenceless in a net of talked, and called up to turn my discreet way of life into a cake walk.

O dear, this living and eating and growing old; there doubts and aches in the back, and want of interest in stars and roses….
  Am I the person who used to make in the middle of the night and laugh with the joy of living? Who worried about the existence of God, and danced with young ladies till long after day break? Who sang “Auld Lang Syne” and howled with sentiment, and more than once gazed at the summer stars through a blur of great, romantic tears.

  I chaperoned Theresa Hulton and Marcella at a dinner at the boy’s, to which also Prince Paul came. 
  Marcella was very silent and distraite, with her dress skipping off her shoulders and leaving her nearly naked. She looked very pretty and very much in love. “John will walk” this time. 
  Geoffrey had a letter from Byba saying Nicky was really coming this summer. It upset him a lot, and so did Marcella’s silence; so that I fear what may happen. It’s really very silly, as they aren’t a bit congenial, and Nicky might be. It seems a crisis in his affairs, but I daresay he’ll pull through.

But it is certainly her other “friend” Mattia Vasconcelos who has done it, thinking to kill two rivals with one stone. She was fearfully indignant that “anyone could think such a thing” - !!

Of every trace of my origin.
I seemed to myself at times to be free
Of every trace of my origin,
I seemed to be reaching the heights of art
And to breathe the air that the master breathed,
And to see the world with their eyes.
But still they’d pass my work and say:
‘What are you driving at, my friend?
Sometimes the face looks like an Apollo’s, 
At other it has a trace of Lincoln’s.’
There was no culture, you know, in Spoon River,
And I burned with shame and held my peace.
And what could I do, all covered over
And weighted down with western soil,
Except aspire, and pray for another
Birth in the world, with all of Spoon River
Rooted out of my soul?”

  She said this flat out, and she (naturally) didn’t like it as to her own life appears full of high purposes and noble striving. It is the incongruous mixture of ideals and facts which enrages Geoffrey and most of her friends. But they had a very dangerous reconciliation, I fear.

  At 7 the Guadagnis came (mother-father- and 2 big boys). Iris took the boys to the Laghetto, while the rest of us and Miss Methuen, saw the house and walked in the garden. The Marchesa Guadagni is an enormous, handsome, vehement, despotic but foolish woman. One would dislike her perhaps, but I feel sorry for her, as she had melancholia for 5 years, with an obsession on the subject of mattresses, which hasn’t entirely left her, for she brings them in as regularly as Brockwell did “The Trustees of the National Gallery”.

A message from Marcella was waiting for Geoffrey that she couldn’t go on their expedition tomorrow, and he mustn’t telephone. He feels into a fearful state of jealousy, as he knew Malvano was back, and telephoned at once, but she was out. He was like a semi crazy person all night.

  Nora is fearfully self-absorbed, and very idle, and she lays to be talking all day long, always about herself. She is very vain not about looks or dress but about her powers, her achievements, her character.

I could hardly look at the dear little child without tears.
  Naima came back to tea – and the Dumonts to dine on the Gamberaia terrace. It was beautiful, but their talk was awful.
  Geoffrey and I walked home, but it wasn’t very pleasant, as I had to complain of his being selfish about my family affection. I don’t want him to be like B.B. and always put difficulties in the way of my going home, and generally show dislike of my fondness for my own family. It has always made things somewhat difficult, and I cannot have Geoffrey going the same way. He is selfish of them – they want me to be exclusively devoted to them. It only makes friction, for I can’t yield there – it is too vital to me. But how I do hate to stand up for myself in criticizing the people I love.

I said he had better talk to Geoffrey and learn the exact truth. He said if it hadn’t been for my warning he’d have run off with her already, throwing everything to the winds.

  After our awful struggle we decided not to go to America, but to remain here till the end of the war. 
  I don’t see how I can bear not to go to England: It is awful for me. But I am tremendously relieved about America. To go and amuse ourselves with fashionable life there in war-time would have been intolerable.

  Dreadful reaction after the momentous decision. I am utterly miserable about England, but B.B. hung the two things together. 
  The Dumonts and Aunt Janet and Hutton dined here. I begin to suspect Hutton’s good faith, or rather, I am sure he is and ever worse confusionista than I. For he told Geoffrey he only confessed to me his love for Yoï, when I said I knew about his letters to her. This time I am sure of my ground. We never mentioned the letters till the second “Yoï” walk, and then he told me of having written. But it is a good reason to give Yoï for having spoken to me, and he clutches at it, and perhaps, in his trouble and muddle, believes it. He said I forced his confidence, and that is not true at all. But it is better to keep out of such things. Let it be a warning.

  The new piece of furniture for B.B. came, and alas the measurements were wrong and the drawers were too small for his photos. What bad luck. I’d have given anything to avoid it. It brought back to him all his old rages and grievances. I wish he dwells as much as the advantages and successes. It does make things nearly unbearable sometimes - such an awful mental atmosphere. 
  Princess Candriano came to tea, and departed promising to bring up lots of her friends. we must avoid this somehow.

  Went to Santa Croce in morning but B.B. was so cross about a baby that cried and a guardian who had a cold and sniffed that it was (for me) all spoiled. He was also perfectly and absolutely unreasonable about the chest of drawers. I think he half believes that the boys were extra careless about it because it was for him! 
  A perfect hopelessness came over me of ever getting behind his furious and unreasonable “complexes,” and having him see things straight. It is truly very sad and painful.

  Marcella came up to tea, and she and Geoffrey had their usual secret and extra-shaking talks. He will never understand her, but it’s fun trying and gives him a feelings of adventure and non-ennui.
  The Salveminis came to dine.
  B.B. talked with Geoffrey about the chest, and Geoffrey said it had been Cecil’s mistake, that they would take it themselves and have another made for him which should have the right measurements. But B.B. already loves the nice piece, and wants to keep it and yet declares he will keep his grievance too. 
  Geoffrey was awfully angry, and I think with reason.

  Got my table in working order, all the notes spread out around me. It is a sort of superior “Patience” and I thoroughly enjoy it. 
  Had an awful row with B.B. because I want to go home for Ray’s confinement. If I do, he will go to America, and I want anything but that. He is awfully selfish. Certainly I should let him go anywhere he liked for a month. It hurts awfully. He says he has put all his eggs in one basket (me) and alas he behaves so that they are added! I am really miserable.

  Perfectly miserable. I cannot bear not to go home. How can B.B. try to prevent me. It is sheer selfishness and lack of consideration for the best feelings I have. It is really too awful. But he threatens me with all sorts of awful consequences if I go, such as his staying in America, getting to hate I Tatti, never trusting me again etc. etc. 
  And as he is clearly the main business of my life, on which my happiness really depends, I must give in. I did hate to make him unhappy - only somehow I don’t believe he would be - what is a month? - and it sounds like crafty and furious talk to get his ends. But why in hell does he want me to stay when it makes me utterly miserable and besides makes me almost hate him and rage secretly against him all the time? It is so silly. It isn’t as if he had stayed [home] from America for me. He gave up the journey himself before I suggested it and because he found the annoyances of travel, and now he makes me, who don’t fear them, give up what is so fearfully vital to me. I can’t bear to think of Ray going through all that suffering without me. It is intolerable.

  Marcella Michela called on Geoffrey and was quite intolerable. She never attempts to control her moods. I daresay he was difficile, too. She said she was sure there wasn’t even a friendship left, as they had taken a strada sbagliata - and then they fell to quarreling about Italy and England. 
  On the whole, it is just as well, for it would certainly queer the Nippy pitch if they went on with the intensità which they started in when she came back from her holiday.

  Hutton came to ask where he could find ass’s milk for Yoï’s baby, who is ill. 
  B.B. rushed out of the room to keep himself from saying “Look in for your own breast”.   Hutton and I telephoned here and there, but couldn’t discover any. “I must get it!” and he actually proposed to send a town crier through the streets of Florence to cry for it. In the end he was persuaded not to, but went off on a quest. It found it might be got at Dicomano, and was starting off but telephoned, and told him to tell Nello and let Nello go for it if he wanted it, as it is his child, and Nello’s parents are very rich. 
  B.B. had tea with Sybil, and I called for him and we walked home. He said Sybil was very sensible and nice about seeing less of him and making no claims. He had to explain to her that he couldn’t go on as he did last winter, but I trust he did so very gently.

  Fearful day of indecision about going home. B.B. is so against it, so afraid, somehow of being left alone, and so far from well, that I gave in and said I would not go, if he felt he really couldn’t spare me. 
  But there must be something he doesn’t say, some “complex” about having given up Belle Greene, and wanting me to give up as much - or something I don’t understand to account for the violence on his expressions.
  I am utterly worn out with it. 
  We took THE walk and found it very beautiful. He seemed to get happy when I said I would not go if he felt so strongly about it.

  The mystery was explained by a telegram for him which was brought to me - from Belle Greene saying that since he couldn’t come to London she would come and stay with him for two weeks in Paris. He had given up London - not for me, but because he couldn’t stand her friend there and the flirtations with them - and he felt bored and depressed and so couldn’t spare me, not even for a most sacred duty of mine and one I cared about awfully. Another reason for me to love that vulgar young person!
  However her coming decides him to go to Paris, so I am graciously allowed to go too.
  As the chief thing I want is to go, I am in the whole glad, but the whole comedy disgusts me and it seems to me very selfish to make me pay for the ennui he feels on her accounts. Still I am glad to go.

  We had an awful morning of bringing up old grievances and resentment - on his side. I really complain of nothing but his temper and I feel absolutely discouraged. He wants more affection and tact and to be made to feel first in everything. I daresay it is a very human longing, but it is not to be had for asking but only for winning. I feel too tired and too put off to dream. I can[’t] give him what he wants, I just can’t, although I am truly devoted to him and he has his way about almost everything. 
  But he is full of craving for more affection and consideration than it seems to be in me to give, and I don’t know what to do. I am fearfully tired of the incessant strife and would almost be glad to go and live at home among good unselfish unexacting people, who aren’t always on the look-out to see whether they are treated as they think they should be.
