Lucy Cooper Hewitt is dead. N.Y. pneumonia. And alas I fear there isn’t a person who will not feel that it is a good thing. She was running horribly to seed in many silly and embarrassing ways. Her life has been a tragedy. I mean of half a million dollars and nothing she cared for but dress and house and jewels to spend it on. It cramps the heart to think of her.
Pellegrino walked w. BB and stayed to tea. She seemed troubled.

BB and Nicky dined at Alda’s w. San Miniatelli, Riri, Russo, Pancrazi etc. Poor Lucy Cooper Hewitt is dead. I fear all her friends are greatly relieved. She was degenerating so sadly.

Vicomtesse de Noailles and Markevitz, San Miniatelli and Riri came to lunch. I have fallen out of step under it all. I try not to be critical.
Brockwell came and I walked w. him in the garden. Then, to fill my cup came Stein. BB left both these worthies to me. I think I prefer them to “smart” people.
In the evng BB gave me his view on the “sacred” picture list, wh. is now complete.

Russo came up and had a walk w. BB and stayed to tea. At tea I felt too ill to hold up my head and crawled off to bed with a fever of 36.6.
Placci came to dine, but I was too ill to get up. It is a slightly delayed reaction to the anti-toxine irrigation of Friday.

Staude and his mother (from Haiti) came to lunch. She is very nice. Aubrey and Johnny came to tea, bringing Johnny’s Eng-German friend, Dotoressa Sussman (Kunst).

Pellegrino, Raniero and Vittoria Cuoghi came to tea. Raniero told me he was the only one who had ever understood the Apocalypse! In the evng we went to Marie Laure’s box to hear 3 orchestral pieces of ultra-modern music. That of Markovitz was the last and had a mixed reception. But it aroused interest and he was called out 6 or 7 times. We went round to see him afterwards. He looked very frail but enchanting!

The latter praised Markevitz highly, said he was the one real musician since Strawinski. But they both agreed that he could not live, being already far gone in consumption (that is why he and Marie-Laure spend most of their time at Davos). They came in ...and I was rather overcome with the tragedy of the situation, for, whatever reason may have first drawn her bliss, she now loves him with her whole heart.

A letter from Barbara says she finds marriage difficult but rejoices in it, as she knows all good things are hard. She says she is more intelligent than “Toby” and works frantically to make him hear “reason” and calculate the difficulties of his plans. “I have common sense for us both”-!!! But he is large-hearted and generous, “a great soul” and she is sure she will “always love him”. Marrying an irresponsible ….. will make her grow up - rather in bliss than in misery.
