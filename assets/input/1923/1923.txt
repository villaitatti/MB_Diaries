We had a New Year’s party for the children, but more grown-ups came even than children. The youngsters enjoyed it thoroughly, hunting for hidden presents and playing Hide-and-Seek all over the house. Cecil and Aubrey were great helps. Sybil and B.B. retired to his study, leaving the rest of us to ourselves.

	Children with little Giulia Mantegazza spend the day in the Quarries, picknicking [sic] and I fetched them at 4  while B.B. and Alys went on a walk.
	Bessie left at noon. She is enormously improved by having an impersonal interest. She is keen about her sculpture and it has made all art, and especially all sculpture interesting to her.
	Storrs came back annoyed and disappointed. Margaret won’t make up her mind. She and Miss Corcos came to dine and the Henraux, and it was a tragic evening with a scene between Storrs and Margt [Margaret], the latter weeping in the music room. Storrs, utterly worn out and discouraged, determined to go away at once.

	All the days behind this have been absorbed in correcting B.B.’s enormously long article on “A possible  and ever impossible Antonello”, which he wrote worse than ever, and left me to put into English. I am just at the end, in bed today with my typhoid inoculation, but getting over the fever which flamed up yesterday. 
	I was in the midst also of a careful letter to Geoffrey ending our old friendship, that is to say, recognizing that its end came of itself when he married a woman I had always detested. Later on, we might indeed meet as friendly acquaintances -- but there will alas be very little point in it ever again I am sure. But at present it makes me miserable to see him, and he gets miserable coming to the house where Nicky lives, whom he is still so desperately in love with. What an idiotic disastrous marriage, poor Geoffrey.

There is nothing in it any longer for me -- Das Lied ist aus -- but just this remains that I shall be much happier when I practically forget him, when he and his doing are as indifferent to me, as those of any other “friend” -- benevolent and distant interest is the thing to be aimed at since we must sometimes meet. Unfortunately he spoke so much like his old self and seemed so desperately broken-hearted over Nicky that I felt nearer to him than for years -- and what is the use with that awful female forever at his side? 
	B.B. was perfectly horrible over a telephone mistake, easily remediable. If he could know any idea how it makes me detest him -- and how the recollection makes doing anything for him horrible. O what a pity it is, when I could be so devoted to him and when he is so nice and kind in big ways.

B.B. felt that the Chartres portals were really finer than these. It is mysterious that the Greeks in the VI century B.C. were really feeling their way, where sculpture elsewhere--as in Egypt--was already on the decay, having solved many essential problems of form. 
	The others went to the Mycenaean room at the Athens museum, but Logan and I were tired and stayed in. Later I left cards and went to tea at the Am(erican) school, where I met Dörpfeld who had nothing to say but his digging.

They picked me up in the park, and we went on in an excruciating wind to Eleusis where we “did” with the help of Baedeker. Logan was very amusing.

	In the afternoon we motored as far as we could into the arms of Hymettus. Then the energetic Porters jumped out and rushed along to a monastery, Caesarionie, ½ hour away, while Nicky sprang up another hill which she had the monastery on top. Logan and B.B. (who had a day of feeling very unwell) remained behind with our old bodies, but afterwards managed to drag them up to Nicky’s hill -- very slowly -- where Anfessi brought us our tea. Then I walked out alone on a ridge that brought me face to face with Mt. Pantelikos. I could see also the Piraeus (,) Salamis and Aegina. It was most beautiful worth coming.

Of course Russia opposed and France was afraid England would get “an Eastern Gibraltar” through her protegèe [sic], Greece. Still, if the King had not vetoed it, it would have been done.

So we walked. It is a terrific climb. But it was lovely looking out from the loggia of the nunnery over “hollow Lucedaemon.” The frescos aren’t very good and are horridly restored. The place picturesque indeed, but the architecture not enrapturing, though good in spots. It’s a terrific journey for what it is. However, we should have been haunted by it if we had not come.

	One of the most awful days of my life, 6 hours on a donkey, on a frightful path of rocks, going and coming from Bassae. My knees were agonizing, but it was too hot to walk up, and too steep, and though I walked half way down, my knees made it nearly impossible. And Lucy Porter buzzed around me so that I could have killed her!
	The Temple is very impressive on its lonely mountain, ringed round by great peaks. But I was so tired that I lay by the a column and closed my eyes most of the time. Still I got even to remember.
	Nicky and Elizabeth washed me and put me to bed. I could only drink some tea. Two bugs raised me and the breakup down first of Lucy’s and then of Elizabeth’s bed.

The Porters left for Colchis in the quest of Byzantine church to photograph, for that, and not seeing is Kingsley’s passion. It is like an obsession, and he pursues it without method or plan, quite wildly and with no regard for what has already been done or what has been published.

	I cannot like the reconstructed Cnidian Temple nor the huge foliated column with dancing women on the top leaves! B.B. is wonderful, he has no art prejudices. He takes it art in, an anything but impartial view of life and people!

He lets her do far too much for him. I am so old that all I can do is to take care of my own health and keep going. Of course it is a very difficult situation for me, this continual contrast between my age and infirmities of body and character with a young woman who is such an angel. Fortunately I love her very much, and if B.B. would only behave politely to me I could manage. As it is, I lie awake hour after hour with almost desperate thoughts and plans.

	Barbara did her lessons. Eugene Strong came to see me, awfully afraid her friend, Mary Lourdes has cancer. She talked one hour and a half full of vigour and energy and interests, unfortunately there were some short circuits--as when she told me how she was promoting Catholic Technical Schools in Jerusalem “which the {something crossed out} Catholics must have, and must turn all the others out of”. Also her wild regret at having been at a dinner party with Osbert Sitwell, and “not known WHO he was”. She says “all Rome” pities Sibyl, who has fallen in love with Geoffrey arrogant as a brother-and-sister basics. 
	Ray and I took Barbara to the Zoo in the afternoon, a dreary place which not even the Baby Giraffe could alleviate

	Letter from Ray at Geneva. -- 
	“Had a whole hour today en tête à tête with Lord Robert (Cecil) in which he talked with his usual simplicity. His view is that, tempting as it was to slap Mussolini back in the face, it was much wiser not to do it. His phrase was ‘I don’t advocate turning the League’s other cheek to him, but waiting till we can bring an action against him for assault battery.” He says that in fact Mussolini -- apart from Mussolini’s blowing off in the newspapers, he has climbed a long way down, and as regards the original dispute, has exacted no more than Greece has all along been willing to give. There remains (1) Corfu and (2) the defiance of the League. As to (1) he expects Italy to withdraw in about 3 weeks [!!!]; if she doesn’t, he says the League must {inserted above: and will} act up to the limit of the Covenant. As to (2) he thinks the League should pass a resolution affirming its compliance-- which Italy must either take part in or not-- and then get a decision from the Supreme Court backing it up. This Italy must be a party to, and leave the League. And he says if she then wants to leave, she may.
	All this is probably wise, but intolerably bad League propaganda, -- as I told ___ will make it ___ that America won’t come in for years. However, a time of strength (even if France were willing) would be most risky -- and, in a way, also bad League propaganda. But I can’t help hoping Mussolini will stick to Corfu and be equally crazy about France, and so force the League’s hand.”

His mind is ignorant and poisoned.
	Placci was much worse. He said to Nicky (his famous tact) “Io giubilo che i tedeschi sono giù, giù,” and he looked like a real brute as he said it. We are not done in finding that he grows intolerable.

It is just possible that when we have been apart for a time we shall be able to get everything straightened out and stop making each other unhappy, but we can’t count on that and are separating on the understanding that it may be for good. We shall see each other often and share the children.

	Lunched with Lady Enniskillen, of whom I am genuinely, if mildly, fond. She is 71. We talk together about growing old. 
	Called on Flora Priestly, who seemed all gone to pieces over the Irish nonsense.
	Called on Mr. Harold Parsons, who was in. Nothing doing there.
	Then on Lady Ross and Lady Dick Lauder, who were out.
	Had tea with Kitsons and she drove me wild with “Protection” gabble.
	Called on poor Miss. Paterson, whose one idea seems to be to come up here, and B.B. can’t bear it, she is so deformed with arthritis. I understand him about this and try to avoid her visits.
	Picked up Cecil and brought him to dine. It seemed rather meaningless, as far as talk went, but I am still found of him and wish him well, although I’m going to employ another architect in future.

First fine day for a fortnight
N[orth]. Italian Giotteschi
	Ray writes hopefully, but I am sure she won’t get in now that a Labour candidate has cropped up. Karin says she hasn’t been so contented and happy for years. 
	Mr. Fuller of Harvard (writing a __ of Greek philosophy) and Placci came to lunch. Placci walked with BB and me while Nicky went to Villa Medici to see Geoffrey, who said he had got over being in love with her. What a blessing--except that there is sure to be someone else, probably there already is. 
	Giulietta Gordignani Mendelssohn came to tea. BB was furious with me for “jumping it on him” when he could not refuse, but he was rather taken with her--I just must “ride roughshod” over him, as he calls it when he’s angry. If it were left to him we should have no old friends and have our universe dark with hate and prejudice.

	Dined with Spelman’s, quite pleasant, only their fire smoked and made our eyes very sore. They are very provincial and wild Ammunikuns, but talented (he in music, she as a writer in a small way) and they are much above the average Florentine.
The gypsies sent a deputation to Ray to say they would vote for her, and she is to go travelling with them, she and her children, if she gets in.

	Had tea with Kitsons
	Nicky dined with Kitsons(.) Countess Eva, Bossi Pucci was there, rather grumpy about her nephew’s marriage with Sophie Serristori, for you know her parents were pro-German.

	Ray had the head of the “bookies” come to tell her they were all voting for her as they thought it wasn’t “sporting” of the Labor man to thrust himself in at the last minute. He told Ray he doesn’t believe in God, a go to Church-- “But I say me prayers neg’l  , ma’am”.

	Went round garden, housekeep--did a lot. There’s a great deal need re-organizing. 
	Someone came to lunch but for the life of me I can’t remember who!
	Madame Narichkine (“Heléne”) and Baron Stiebel came to dine and the evening seemed very long. I wonder if they are as bored as we are. They express much pleasure--but so do we. 
	I begin to realize that “The King is naked”, as Tolstoi used to say.

	Lady Enniskillen and Flora Priestly and Mrs. Ross came to lunch.
	What are Ray’s Bougees and Gypsies and Bookies and all the rest doing today?? It is almost too exciting.
I called for Blandine Gravine and took her to the Varesina Choral which was good, but not up to the other Chorals I’ve heard. 
	We spent a pleasant evening listening to her read aloud Grimm’s Tales and talking of German books.
	She told me she nearly committed suicide for sheer misery and went last year in Bayreuth.

	Began Orcagna and Johnsons. 
	Well, Ray did not get in this time either. I had a telegram this afternoon. It upset me beyond reason, because I truly think she will make more of her life by sticking to literature. The novel, “Machine On”, is really a very remarkable piece of work and she can do better still. But sh! HOW I wanted the child to have her desire. 
	It poured and poured. Byba and her little lover came up to call, but said nothing much. 
	Nicky read aloud the story of the young man who was made Calif for one day.

Walked with B.B. And Monte Senario most beautiful and wonderful air. He felt rather ill and Giglioli thought the light air would do him good.
	The von Bachs, cousins of Nicky’s, came to lunch. He had been Russian attaché in Washington. The [sic] still believe that the ancient regime will come back, “soon.”
B.B. and I dined with Mrs. Kenyon Cox, and it was very pleasant. Marilli, whom I’m turning into a supplementary chauffeur, drove us up, while the servants went to the Theatre.
Poor old Ray! Yet I’m glad she will go on writing.

Orcagna School
	Geoffrey came over to lunch and he BB nearly quarrelled over politics, then they absently agree. But BB puts things so wildly, with such maddening exaggeration. I had a little talk with him, and he said he was getting on better. Taking hold of life a bit. It is a life which I scarcely ever care to hear about--voilá for our long intimacy, which we thought was stronger than death! How silly humans can be. 
	Sybil came to snatch him for a walk, and BB and I had a delightful but too long one.

	No work
	Went to look for plants, endless house hold things, wrote Christmas letters.
	Quarry walk-- leaving Nicky at Villa Medici to walk with Geoffrey. She says he talks a lot about himself, but, though he expresses une amitié chaude for her, he never asks her a thing about her life or interests. The chaleur suffices him, but she says there are no grounds of real interest of congeniality between them, and I fear this is so.

Still the Orcagna circle--
	Aubrey and that tiresome  cousin Miss Erskine came to fine, Lina being laid up with a cold Aubry asked me what I thought of their buying the Aulla Castle, and I am sorry to say I told him. He is one of the most selfish men I ever knew and his selfishness has no excuse for Lina, so clearly the superior person, AND the breadwinner. But he sulks and scolds and insists he is going to march her away to that remote place where he can paint pictures no one will buy, and she cannot do her journalism, with which they live. It is monstrous!

	B.B. as cross and nasty as hell. He feels ill, but -- Oh for a polite, easy-going companion, who didn’t turn every little incident into sordid disgustingness. Poor B.B. -- and poor me. Well, Nicky is perfect.
	He took a drive and walk with Sybil, who said Geoffrey required incessant “amusement” (i.e. she bores him, as I prophesied), and had no resources in himself. B.B. advised her to leave him as free as possible. And she talks of going without him to Palestine and Syria {inserted above: in the Spring} while he is going along to London in January.
	Nicky and I shopped for Christmas and then I called for Gaetano and Blandine and took them up.

Ojetti and De Filippi came to dine.
Nicky told of the custom in Calabria at the funeral of a young unmarried man. All the girls accompany the bier, singing and lamenting and pretending to tear their hair. If there is a fidanzata, she really tears her hair. They chant stornelli
“Fuoco mio acenerito”
	“Bastimento mio affondato in mare”
