Bronchial cold.
Shepheards’ [sic] Hotel							. Cloudy
Simaika Pasha called for us at 9.30, and Mrs. (Labouchere) Mackintosh, and we drove around and picked up Col. Storrs (The Governor of Jerusalem!!) and went out to the delightful Coptic Museum, where we spent 2 hours. The early carved wooden door and a ditto screen were particularly interesting. Saw the Roman gate, now far below the level of the town which certainly rises incredibly! I suppose they are too lazy to burn their rubbish.
	On the way Storrs told the Pasha, who is the head of the Copts, about the Holy Sepulchre rows. An immemorial custom grants free access to walk round the Tank to everyone, but the Copts have a Chapel on the back and 3 times a wk. for 2 hrs. They spread out and fill up the passage. The Franciscans, to assert the old custom, make a point of sending servants carrying food for some nuns right through the crowd of worshipping Copts, who retaliate by throwing water on the “Way to the t” ? where the Catholic procession has to haul!!
	Stopped at the desolate romantic mosque of Amr.

Also a falling to ruin Palace near by with one open loggia and a lovely musharahi in the harem. BB. and Mrs. D. went on, but I drove Bonté to her train, and called on Eliza at the Cheziral Hospital (Anglo-American). She has a lovely quiet room, and a nice nurse, but she looks dying, v. white and all teeth, like a skull. Had a 4th varicose veins electrical treatment, and came home to find Mr. Russell here (Chief of Police), a handsome sporting man, whose wife, BB. says, has a mind like a yard measure that only bends at same places.

 played gloriously—a great artist. We met the Mackintoshes, Elgoods, Sérionnes, Russells, Storrs, Creswell, Mme. Foucart, and various then new acquaintances.
Mrs. De Kaven writes “I am well and for the moment restored to the normal-by companionship [Spender] I shall never be free from suffering without it. I have lived the life à deux too long.

A cut had been made in the mound _____ on the top, the modern mud houses, then the Copt (some of teal brick), then 2 strata of Arab towns, then Greek. He had not yet got down to the level of the Temple, where he hoped to find Egyptian remains.
Edfu is the best preserved, but it somehow left us cold, like St. Owen, you _____ it off. But the capitals are glorious, and of course it is impressive.
Read Reisner’s Gifford lecture on the Egyptian view of Immortality—apparently, from all the authorities, a materialistic, matter-of-fact affair, but dangerous, needing rites and offerings and magical words to get you safely along. We have yet to find the first trace of the spiritual in it.

I sat on the sand and slid down, sand and all, without a line of drapery being disarrayed. B.B. said “I am here to look, not to play” and thumped painfully down along the moraine of rocks at the side.

	The “petrified love story”, [sic], as Wahrlich called it, Rameses’ Temple for Nefertari, is also very grand. The great figures seem to be marching out of the mountain.

	Too tired to do anything, but BB and Nicky spent the day at Medinet Habu. I wrote to Karin for her 33rd birthday (Mar. 10), to Barbara (for her whooping cough) to Creswell, Mrs. Devonshire, Lisa Curtis for Ralph’s death, Paul Manship, Alys.
	Mr. W. H. Truman, Ed? Inspector, dined with us and was most interesting about native customs.
	Met Lady Carnarvon.

	We are gradually getting the feeling as of catching echoes of some nightly symphony played by an [sic] huge orchestra. Compared to it European art seems like chamber music.
	Here is no religion of renunciation, of resignation, of annihilation—but fierce self-assertion, even—and especially—beyond the grave, of unquestioned mate and triumphant materialism.
	However shall we manage to tear ourselves away from this overwhelming thing?

El Kab										        Mahamid
Train at 10 reaching Mahamid at 12. Incredible donkeys awaited us and conveyed us—somehow—to the Rest House at El Kab where Mr. Somers Clarke and luncheon awaited us. He is over 80, of the disappearing type, unchanged by residing abroad, sturdy and vain and ruling the natives. They seem to adore him. Certainly there’s a bit of “Number 2” in it, probably innocently.
He showed us El Kab, and we sailed up in his felucca to the house he built himself in a cliff over the Nile.
It revealed possibilities of life here. But I should not attempt being a hermit without plenty of money to build a comfortable house, get good food and service and a supply of books!!

	Mounted on bridle-less, stirrup-less donkeys, we rode over the desert to see the Temples and Inscriptions on the road from the ancient gold quarries to the Nile.
	Dear old Somers Clarke got rather boring. He is deaf, so I had to keep up the conversation. I was worn out when we left him after lunch in his rest-house.
	But it was worth doing.

	Went to the Valley of the Kings. The Tomb of Seti I has a nearer approach to compositions in our sense than almost anything in Egyptian Art.

	Expedition to Abydos—3 hrs. riding across the cultivation. It nearly killed me with pain in my knees, but it was worth it. It is I think the greatest monument of the XIX Dynasty in Egypt, the sculptures being of that delightful kind of the paintings in the Tomb of Seti. It is true that the touch is less delicate and nervous than in the Tombs of Ramesi and Cha-en-het, which recall Desiderio and Agostino da Duccio [sic] at their best, but the compositions are more varied and more like “compositions” in our sense.
	We ached to look on last on these {long arrow} proud, self-asserting Kings thrusting symbols of life into the noses of the Gods, gazing at them with level eyes, as powerful as their own deities.

You are too much in it yourself to realize to what a degree she is merely a product of her year, her class, her country, I mean her mind and its contents she has no standards, no values, no ideals deliberately different from what she, as a product of her milieu, should have. Not that only, she seems to have been receptive only at a certain moment and never again. She absorbed a universe some 10 or 15 years ago.

She finds me very intolerant, exclusive and arrogant. I am. But the dangerous thing is that she has a mind. This will prevent her taking nonsense simply.

	Still in sandbanks. It is growing a bore, especially as Philomène is very nervous at being out of reach of news from her little daughter.
	With all her charm she exasperated me terribly by her second-rate arguments. She has been thoroughly poisoned by fashionable Jesuitism, and is too fundamentally uneducated to see through it. She repeats their arguments like a vehement and rather acrimonious parrot. BB. mercifully finds her stimulating. He enjoys the talk her folly draws out of him. She is as sensitive as a sea-medusa to the least hostile current, and stiffens herself up to spit against it like a cobra. Sometimes you wonder why that particular innocent remark draws out her venom, but you soon realize that she is clever enough to feel that its implications are anti-Catholic, anti-immortality, anti-nationalistic.

The great masses remain geometrically firm yet seem to melt into the sky.
	To Guido— “There is certainly enough in the world around us—indeed even in ourselves—to fill us with horror and dismay and grief. What is so extraordinary and incomprehensible about the old Egyptians is that they did not seem to feel this—they never expressed it.

Seeing it electrifies one’s nerves. Of course I didn’t believe _____ the beginning of it. Man is a corruptible worm, and his life is full of sadness and failure. All the same, it elates me to find that human beings once asserted, proudly and mendaciously, the opposite.

	We re-saw the Tombs of Ptah-hotep and Ti, and they were less vital in handling than we had been thinking. All the same one feels a very strong current of life and invention still running, which in the later things ceased, though the invention was great enough to carry the art unchanged and yet beau grand and beautiful through thousands of years.

	“She made her great bid for freedom by running away with a young married man, whom when their child was born, she discovered to be “a mere biological factor”. Having done this, she feels perfectly assured that she thinks for herself, and she regards all the neo-Catholic, ultra St. Germain, Jesuitical prison (distilled in part by our good Abbé Meunier) which she has, alas, only too well assimilated, as self-generated and mysteriously significant. She’s not a bit interested in things, only in herself and the suggestions of mystery and romance that certain picturesquenesses araise [sic] in her.

He said if there had ever been any harmony between him and Sybil, to make a fond of happy relations, and he had then got her on his nerves as he has now done, he would say he had to go clear away and be left to himself for two years. But she has been so considerate, within her limitations, and things have been so beastly, owing to me and to his falling in love with Nicky, that he feels he came to ask for it. It is clear that the worst I thought about her misuitability [sic] as a wife for him is realizing itself. Let us hope she’ll take a lover—if she hasn’t done so already in Percy Lubbock—and leave him alone. This is all Friday the 28.

We feel that N.[aima] does such a lot for us that we must pay her more than her normal fees. And I gave her 20000 marks (only about £8.10 really) to get some clothes on her way home in September.

Lucerne				An ideal hotel!
	The festa of a local Saint and worse than a British Sunday! The Police go around to fine anyone who does business. We had to sneak into the Steinmeyer-Böhler picture-shop, and the police actually came and tried the door. We spent the day there looking at their remarkable coll[ection] of Italian pictures, antique jewellery and medieval objets. It is quite wonderful what they have got together! We lunched with them, and when I came back for a half an hour’s nap, B.B. up and bought a little picture by Ercole Roberti for 12000 Swiss francs. They said that every single thing in Mr. Wendlandt’s house is for sale! He is entirely a dealer, not a collector, but yet he does live with great taste and refinement.

Both these calls alas I enjoyed more than the morning which Geoffrey spent with me. How changed from when we talked as freely as breathing. He is very much under the influence of his friend Terence Phillip, who lives an intense inner life but a most ridiculous and disordered outer one, and Geoffrey’s natural tendencies along with this young man’s influence make him think it very fine and glorious and despise all other forms of life.
