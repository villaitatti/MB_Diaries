He says Giolitti means to try to snatch the power from Salandra, where the House reassembles, and for that if he can find a good Casus Belli, Salandra may declare war first. Von Bülow is constantly seeing Giolitti, who would come in with a Neutral Policy. But Pl.[acci] says he would change it to War fast enough once he was in the seat. What miserable business it is–determining such things by such motives!

  Poor B.B. is not well. I feel really troubled and anxious about him. He doesn’t sleep well, and he can’t digest. Most of the time he feels awfully tired.
  Yoï and Nello came to dine. Nello was charming. Yoï had a sneezing cold, and her manner was cooler and to me much more agreeable. The more intimate she feels the more she puts me in a false position by taking it for granted I “understand” and “sympathize with” all her foolishness.

Nello came in late, and when we were going Yoï kept back Geoffrey to whisper to him that she heard “from all sides” that we hadn’t liked her meeting him here and taking a long walk with him. She was evidently blaming him for our criticism of her–so silly. It all came from her babbling to Stan Krayl about the walk, only half truths revised with lies, and where Stan spoke to me of it, I said I thought it was wrong of Yoï to deceive Nello and try to keep poor Geoffrey on. I am for myself glad Yoï heard of it, but it upsets Geoffrey to have her furious with him. However, I believe it is good for him in the long run.

He will feel that after all the world, his world is too big to let her play such an overwhelming part in it.

  This year, for the first time in my life, I feel peaceful and at leisure. Nothing hurries or bothers me. It comes from having good health and very fine people to see and make social arrangements for.

  Later I called on poor Mrs. Ross, who has fallen into a sad apathy. She sits all day by the fire, only stirring to make it up, and shuddering and wincing from time to time as if someone struck her.

  A most interesting letter from Geoffrey describing the “confusione” that reigns in the Relief work in the Abruzzo.  They spent the night at Balsorano (Friday).

But the human animal is unlike that. I fear.

It is a perpetual question, up, down, shall we? should we? devoid of all dignity or moral importance. In the end I fear I will depend rather on Giolitti’s parliamentary juggling than on any respectable reason.
Cecil came up in the car which took the Gays back. He has had a hard but most interesting time at Balsorano. The greatest discomfort he suffered was from a finger that one amateur Red Cross doctor seized upon and burned nearly to the bone with undiluted iodine, which he tied up on the finger!

He has in fact put up one, which comes very close to looking like a tenement house! They have a really darling little girl, a year and 8 months old–so intelligent.
Yoï is very seasick and miserable already dreads her confinement next next [sic] October. Olga, who was sick for 9 months, day and night, says nothing will ever induce her to have another baby.
BB dined with Sybil.

  Placci came to lunch. This time the orario della partenza in guerra is again set forward. We mobilize in March and go to war in April. But we got the impression that he was vehement rather than confident.
I took him to see Mrs. Ross, and then did errands etc. in town and called again on Yoï.

  Bad rheumatism, but had a long walk with Geoffrey, very delightful in the new wealth of sunshine and blue hills. We called on the Priest at Vincigliata, a nice cultivated little person, fond of music and languages. Walked 3 hours–it was so enchanting.

  Woke still rheumatic. Giglioli advised taking atophan. It was glorious walking, such spring sunshine, daffodils and anemoni and narcissus out, and pussy-willows all grey by the streams. But Geoffrey was very gloomy and seemed to spread a blackness over the sky, which I could only just manage to pierce here and there. I wanted awfully to walk off by myself and really enjoy all the loveliness. He was only cross because Sybil was all in a turmoil about his worries of Cecil enlisting, and Lady Enniskillen having reported her as “working to that end” some ten days ago. I was silly to have repeated this to BB as I might have known the coil it would cause. Well, I might have repeated much worse!!

But she agitated him talking a lot about Yoï. Cecil and I had a walk. BB called on Mrs. Ross. Sunday is his “day off” from Sybil.
  A most beautiful day. But I was sad because Ray’s hopes for and another baby have come to nothing. I sent her £10 as a consolation present, poor child. She is awfully disappointed.

  No home letters—but better War news–the Dardanelles really attacked and troops landing in the Gallipoli peninsula. Russian making a stand and even advancing, “blockade” fizzling out, and the “Dacia” towed by the French into Brest.
Walked with Bernhard halfway to la solita Sybil, and there called on Mrs. Ross and Miss Erichsen. Nello came to dine, but without Yoï, who is still sick. Oh but I envy her for Ray!
Geoffrey tells me that Byba Giuliani, who observes very keenly, thinks Yoï is neither contented nor happy, and that the marriage cannot turn out well. Italians read these things quickly. I think Byba knows nothing of the facts, but she sees Yoï is false and feels her to be dissatisfied.

  Mr. Gentner, director of the Worcester Museum (Massachusetts) came to lunch, and to see the pictures. While BB and Sybil motored I took a 2 ½ hrs. walk all over the quarries on Monte Ceceri. It was very beautiful and I enjoyed it in spite of being still bedeviled with “uric acid”. The Mugello mountains were entirely covered with snow and Vallombrosa more or less.
I enjoy walking alone more than with anyone.

Motored over after lunch (Benn) and saw the town. BB and Sybil came in her car, but were late, having been to San Gimignano. Sybil reduced us all to complete silence by a flood of dull sub-comic self-absorbed talk. It was really horrible, and we decided to fly away and leave BB to bear it. As he is in the silly shape of infatuation he probably likes it. I think she is a nice person behind all this appalling rubbish, but I wish he would some time choose an amie whom one didn’t have to explore in the subterranean depths to like.

D'altre opere e di questo Ercole invitto
Io Giuseppe Catini fui l’autore
Che dopo aver nella cucina fritto
Feci a tempo avanzato lo scultore.

Mestiere esercitai di mal umore
E studiai fui d’archittettura un poco
Fui comico, pittore, poeta e cuoco

Mrs. Baldwin has lost her beauty, poor thing, but keeps the values of a frivolous adventuress. It is very painful–horrible.

  Mrs. Baldwin recounted to me the whole Gladys-Marlborough epic, how they were devoted to each other through 14 years of trial, and how those “dirty hounds” the “Yanks,” i.e., the Duchess’ Mother and friends put the blame on angel-innocent Gladys.
  They quarreled like maniacs, till once, quarreling about Titian, Gladys bit his hand, and he thrashed her nose till it cracked, and she has been an angel ever since!

 Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott 
  Motored from Caprarola. Had lunch by Lake of Bolsena. Saw Monteoliveto.
Found letter from Inez Boisservaire, who has been sent home by the Italian Government. She richly deserved it!
“I’m not pro-German–” she wrote, “not in the least–nothing would grieve me more than a German victory–except a victory for the Allies. I am against war–all war–that is all. And if this war ends with a victory gained by military strength, we shall have militarism rampant in the world for a long time to come. I want an intelligent adjudication and I want it soon. And I don’t go on the theory that any parties to the certified are more to blame than the others. I am not interested in placing blame. I am interested in avoiding such stupidities for the future.”
The Italian government evidently was interested in avoiding such stupidities for the present.

  Left Siena at 10 and lunched under Volterra, having seen the Villa Celsa first–charming connecting gallery, chapel and gardens by Peruzzi.
  Saw Laré and inspected the Bagni di Casciano–nel caso mai.
Reached here in time to see the most glorified sunset there ever was from the city wall.
  BB writes “Sybil amuses me a bit and annoys me more by the indirection wherewith she goes back as every plan we make directly her hotel-keeping preoccupations demand it. Today another lot of ‘officers’ arrive and their indirection will take up most of her energies for the rest of my stay….The fact is, I wish you were back.

  We saw today 6 interesting XVIII century villas: 1) Mansi, with street of water surrounded by parapet and statues and a fountain-grotto with Diana and Actaeon.  
2) Villa Torrigiani, with glorious cypress avenue, and charming sunk garden, and diverting jeux d’eaux to wet the runway. 3) Villa dei Vescovi, the most liveable-in of all, a lovely situation, and fine baroque entrance to wood 4) Villa della Principessa, inhabited by a mad Bourbon prince, Principe di Capua, who for 40 years hasn’t spoken to anyone, and gets in a rage of anyone goes near him. He sits all day from 6 till sunset on his front step, and throws away all his plates and cups. We saw him throwing away his tea things–made of enamel or horn, of course–a bent old figure with white hair. The place is magnificent and has a green theatre and glorious water-garden. 5) Villa Rossellini with fine loggia and 6) Villa Bernardini, with large ilex groves and a lovely water garden.

Saw Cecil off to Florence and then Geoffrey and I motored to Massa, got out our permits to stay in the Zona di Guerra and came on here to visit Mascha and her husband, Arthur Travers-Borgström. They seem very comfortable  and happy. He had a terrible drinking-fit for a month when they first came, and such D. T.s that 2 men could hardly control him, but since then he has been very nice. It is a madness, poor man, and he quite forgets what he does or says.

	Took Mrs. Ross to lunch with the Dumonts. Then called on Horne who lives most uncomfortable in a stuffy little room at the top of his bare Palazzo, which he has furnished with a Carlo Dolci and a picture painted on variegated marble. He seemed very ill, but very keen, as always, about “collecting” (also about selling, I fancy). Then I went to see Yoï, who vaunted the return of her figure to its wanted grace after her 4th maternity. She had stood up nude for Nello to inspect it in every detail, and he was–enraptured!

  At last tackled my little writing room and emptied and arranged the drawers of letters and papers. I found that card of Donnino's whose loss (ie careful putting away!) caused such well-deserved fury.
  In the afternoon, while BB called on Sybil, who was ill in bed, I took our old “rampart walk,” around the hill to Fiesole, and enjoyed it immensely. There we called on the Bassianos.
  Coming back we heard the bad news of our little Henri’s death–the very best servant there ever was, and one of the nicest men. We both feel it very much, and so do all those who knew him.

  The Travers-Borgström came to tea. She does fuss. BB dined with Sybil.   
I have given up hope about Cecil. His character is too weak for his talents to prosper. All these years I have hoped and excused or hoped, but something has snapped.  BB is also unhopeful for his future and I think Geoffrey is also. Such a pity, for he has genius.
  Ray has a choice of and wants Friday’s Hill Cottage, where she spent her childhood. I’ve had to advise her against it, as we none of us know what the war may do to our money. She is busy getting women to work on munitions.

The latter, after going to see Herbert Horne every day for 4 years, and spending from 1-5 hours at each visit, suddenly stopped, about a year ago, and hasn’t been near him since. Pure caprice.

  Salvemini and Madame Luchaire came to dine, his last evening before going North. The horror of it gripped and held us so that we could scarcely find anything to say. That a brilliant upright useful man like that–the nicest Italian we have ever known–should throw his life away for the Trentino or Trieste is fantastic–and tragic. I wept after he had gone. Salvemini was very distressed at Italy’s taking no actions in the Balkans. Altogether he feels something “poco chiaro” in her present policy.

  Villino, servant’s clothes, Aristea’s pickup, chair-covers, carpets etc. in morning. How constantly a big house keeps one employed!
  I took Mrs. Ross in in the afternoon: it upsets my own plans, but she enjoys it, and it makes me feel the motor is of use. I called on Mascha while she called on Professor Villari who feels as Salvemini does about the situation.
  Sybil came to lunch, brimming over, as usual, with her own affairs. She is an A [sic] Number 1 Bore. She is so fearfully self-absorbed, she notices nothing.

  Same foot trouble as 2 years ago after Brides-les-Bains–this time after Bath. I think it’s called Intertrigo. Feels like shingles. Naima trying Kundan Lal’s massage, i.e. bringing blood down into feet and holding it there while she massages toes, pushing it back and then massaging calves of legs.
  Read over our old letters of 1890-94. This amuses and interests me very much.  
  BB motored with Sybil. Geoffrey had tea-party of Mascha and her husband and Marcella Michela. He might fairly easily fall in love with the latter, but I hope he won’t as she is poor.

I had a little walk with Geoffrey and Bernard, and this was a treat, for me, at any rate. They both seem well.

  BB dined with Cecil, who had had a letter from Percy Lubbock saying that while he was in the office of the Foreign Edition of the “Times”, the Dutch Ambassador came in great haste and importance to ask what line the “Times” would take if Germany proposed Peace on the basis of the status quo ante.

  Vida Bispham and her husband Riccardo Daddi came to dine. He is a nice young fellow, serious and good, but delicate and with a harsh voice. She is certainly very boring. They’re horribly poor–£200 (francs) a month.

  Accounts–how complicated! But I shall manage these. Sybil came and walked with BB and I went to Dr. Banti about my heart. He says it’s only uric acid–the old foe–and not functional, so I needn’t bother. It has been such a queer sensation hearing and feeling it always pumping away. However now I shan’t bother. I brought Lina up from town. She sent over to Geoffrey her first chapter of “Sicily”, a regular outpouring à la Symond-cum-Hutton, but not badly done for that.

  Called for Mrs. Ross and Miss Hunter and went to the Red Cross Entertainment at Villa Medici. The lights went out for nearly all the time, but at the end Iris’ Play “The Slippers of the Princess” got its lighting. It was very pretty, and all ended well. We felt pretty tired just from seeing, and Cecil who did it all looked a ghost.
  Guido went at 11:30. We had a long talk. He said he was awfully anxious and distressed about Italy’s policy, feared a secret and disgraceful treaty with Germany, etc. 
  Yoï was there and rather played off Nello and Geoffrey, making them both uncomfortable, and Geoffrey acutely miserable and sea-sick.

BB by no means “adequate”. Walked a little in garden in high mind.
  Mr. Mrs. Dumont came bringing Mr. Flowroy, the expert in American passports. They said Volpi had gone to America with 4 million of goods to sell, and that his son-in-law, Ciampolini came in the awful state saying his young concubine had 2 confidants on board who meant with her aid to rob him. They wanted her prevented from entering, but mismanaged so that he too is held up, under a sort of White       Slave law, not allowed to enter!

  The boys went round the grounds and buildings. I went to town at 2:30 and had a most horrid session of dressmaking, or (worse still) dress correcting. Called on Mrs. Dumont and Mr. Batcheler who said the Germans had returned with everything but GOD. Nothing but GOD could have stopped their march at Paris. I suppose He didn’t care about Brussels or Antwerp. “Oh” she said “but that is only for a time”.

  What a heavenly day. We planned things in the garden. Then the boys and I went to Villa Beccari to buy bees, but all the people have gone to fight. Geoffrey and I called on Mascha, who is just leaving for Lucerne. She said the Loesers most trusted servant had been caught and confessed to having stolen from them every day. His room was full of pilfered things, but, worse still, undelivered letters. Someone stole Mrs. Loeser’s passport and money–probably an ex-servant as a vendetta–and this led to all the rooms being searched and this man discovered.
  I sympathize with him. I hear on all sides that my beloved Aristea was a filthy traitoress or disloyal wretch.

  BB and I walked on a new road leading to the Madonna del Sasso. Too beautiful, I left him at Sybil’s and picked up the boys and went to the Dumont’s “Thanksgiving” reception. Mr. Gregory Swift promised me some more gourd-seeds. Dumont said that he warned the Prefetto and Volpi’s other friends that if they did not give him the letter they promised on Sunday by 4 on Wednesday he would call to the NY authorities that Volpi was not a character to allow into the US.  This he did: to their surprise and rage when they turned up with the letter on Thursday morning!!  This is so characteristically Italian that I can’t imagine how they ever carry on any concerted warlike operations.

I lunched with Naima, to taste the skill of the new cook, Margarita, whom I am engaging. She seems very good.

  Had to go to town–a great shame as such a lovely day. Dressmaker and furrier–neither of them ready.
BB called on Sybil.
  We are just buying a new property (to safeguard our view) which has houses on it, and BB said he didn’t mean to do a single thing to these houses, he loathed the people and didn’t care a damn if they lived in unsanitary conditions, and wished them all in hell anyhow. It is so silly. Of course if we own houses we must keep them decent. It gave me an indescribable feeling amounting almost to a sort of illness to hear such talk, such brutal selfishness and lack of responsibility and such unkindness. It took me hours and hours to get over it, though I said “it’s only talk”.

  When we came in, Prince Paul of Serbia, Nello and the weird-looking, tiger-eyed Marchesa Casati were here. They stayed a long time.
  The Consul and his wife came to lunch. They say Loeser without a passport may have to go back to America, as the US wishes to have no German-Americans living abroad at this moment, and it is making it very awkward for them.

  Called on Placci, here for 24 hours between Udine and Rome. He had a talk with Cadorna and other big wigs. He says he KNOWS that Italy is silently going to declare War on Germany! That Romania and Greece will follow suit, and probably Bulgaria! Wonderfully good news, if true: but I can’t believe it. I think Greece will go with Germany and Romania too. The Bassianos and Marainis came to dine. Geoffrey stayed away, and it was as well, for Yoï really looked very beautiful, in spite of signs of age.

  BB arrived with Sybil and Iris, Irene, Temple and the boys at 5 Via delle Terme, to go to see the Italian “Grand Guignol“. 
Luckily they gave comedies chiefly. Splendid actors the Sainati couple, and all of them, really.

Mrs. Batcheller has such a passion for the Great, that she was really interested in it. She sang ballads to us and the “The Last Rose of Summer”–a surprising but not sympathetic voice, very high, and an unmusical unspontaneous manner of singing. But it was a pleasant evening.

  Cecil came up to inspect the falling bridge and the unsafe wall of our house on the stream–both due to the remissness of the Comune in accepting our offer to pay ½ expenses of a necessary dam. BB lost his temper over it, and said he wouldn’t do a thing, he wanted his house to fall down, etc. etc. and damn the Comune instead of the stream.
It took Cecil ½ hour to bring him to reason. I do hate to see him make such a silly spectacle of himself.
  Prince Paul, who has been ill, came to tea, and Geoffrey and me went the evening trying to make up, while BB dined with Sybil. Of course a hump, being unreasonable, is not dispersed by argument. However. I’m so fond of him, it can’t last.

I got the hump again, at the sort of casual way, coming in and ordering tea at 7 and being so smisurati–but it goes with Youth, and I’m fearfully glad for Geoffrey to have a good time. The truth is, I got anxious about them, as it was so dark and I thought she might have slipped and turned her ankle.

I went to town and called on Miss Cochrane and Herbert Horne, and stopped at Geoffrey’s to pick him up: but Byba Guiliani was there and took no hint to leave, so I came away at 7, and Cecil brought him back later in Sybil’s little car. Byba is evidently in love with him, poor little thing–little suspecting what her friend has done in her absence. Both these girls behave as no well brought up English or even American girls could behave. Their talk about wanting emancipation to “become themselves” is amusing–it simply means to be free to run after young men. That is very natural, too, but their language is a travesty in the facts.

However, she is independent and original and interesting, a real personality. He stayed on to dinner in spite of Yoï’s coming, and I think Nello had a horrid evening. Mrs. Ross and Lina came too.

Geoffrey and I, like two old idiots, talked till the new year came in about Marcella, whom he envisages as a mermaid or nymph or form of dryad, only half human, not quite understanding the human portion of her actions. I reserve judgment, but I think she is only a vicious, headstrong, sensual (but gifted) girl, very self-absorbed, I fear 1916 will bring him horrid unhappiness.
