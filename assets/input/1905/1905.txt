with Houghtons on lagoon towards Manncenno where Ray had a hot swim.
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, July 5, 1905 Cold going. Hotter 100º.
Meet Houghton at Treviso. Man gone, no work going on. Wild rage and
despair. Decided to send motor, all taken to pieces as it is, to Florence for repairs there.
Saw S. Nicholas and Duomo and took 4.39 train back to Venice. 3/4 hour late. Met Bonte and Maurice Sheldon Amos and had a little chat.
Found B.B. in a fury, very rude and unkind when I came back. He went to dine with Hohenlohe, Duc de Richelieu and Finzi. We dined with Houghtson, who were perfect angels of tack and kindness about the motor.
Andermatt with Ray

Went to S. M. della Passione and S. Lorenzo, Gaudì’s and Cavenaghi’s. Took 12.30 train to Göschenen and came here.
Talking of taste, Bernhard made the horrid remark that it only began
where appetite ended.
Fine.
$$HEADER$$_Saturday, July 8, 1905
Walked to Hospenthal in morning and up through the woods in afternoon. B.B. said that pleasure to be unalloyed and entirely enjoyable must be mediocre. He also said art was a concession to our feeble powers of taking in the universe.

Shopped some more. B.B. went out with Hubert in the morning and saw “Les Arts Décoratifs”.
Rembrelinski called in afternoon — two hours.

Saw the moonlight on the Grand Terrace.
$$HEADER$$_Saturday, July 15, 1905

$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, July 19, 1905
Went to Gustave Moreau Museum and Sedelmeyer’s (rue de la Rochefoucauld).

Motoring with M. Henraux
[p93] 
$$HEADER$$_Thursday, July 20, 1905
B.B. went to Louvre and Musée Grumeaux. We did not start on our trip till 5. The motor is a splendid machine, but the workmen constructing it
have been on strike and have done things carelessly, and almost with malice. It is a 24 h.p. Charnau. We burst a tire 8 km. from Sens, which brought us late there.

Did the Cup Circuit (137 km). Wonderful scenery.
[p94]
$$HEADER$$_ Monday, July 24, 1905 Fine with a little rain.
A very beautiful day. We went first to Vic-le-Comte (original little church), Château Buron, and lunched at Issoire. Then we went to St. Nectaire, Murol and came to Murat to sleep. All the time passing through the most beautiful country conceivable. Also saw little town of Besse.

$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, July 26, 1905
Fine.
“Did” Le Puy. The Cathedral is the best shrine to a Cult I ever imagined. It is endlessly interesting. We also climbed up to St. Michel.
Left at 3 and reached Le Lioran — a tourist place — at 8, a most enchanting ride. Saw St. Flour whose silhouette is marvellous.
Delicious air — this is about 4,000 feet high.
B.B. much less cross.

Cloudy with rain.
An unfortunate day. The roads were atrocious and maimed the motor, and Placci was simply abominable, he can be as disagreeable at he can be charming.
We saw Tortona, which was not interesting, except for the Macrino,44 and Casale Monferrat, which was horrid, and then the Sanctuary of Crea,45 with lovely views.
We got here at 9 wet through, and not having paid the call on the Visconti-Venostas that Placci had set his heart on.
$$HEADER$$_Friday, Sept. 29, 1905

Placci woke up in a good humour, and said so, as if that was all there was in it. he is a baby.
The motor was mending, after those horrible roads. B.B. and I spent the morning pumping the amiable Vesme.
In the afternoon we went to Santena46 to see the Visconti-Venostas47 and

Started at 9. Reached Bergamo about 10 and left our trunks, and then went on to Alzano Maggiore and Olera — a delightful spot up in the hills, with a fine Cima.
After lunch we “did” Bergamo in four hours. The new hotel, Hotel
Moderno, is such a relief after what we have had at Bergamo always before. Only one flea in the night!
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, Oct. 4, 1905

Started at 7.45 and did the tour of Bergamo up to the Castello — glorious! Then visited Malpaga and Torre Pallavicina, and Soncino and lunched at

Milan and Gazzada
[p119]
$$HEADER$$_ Thursday, Oct. 5, 1905
Placci changed his mind and B.B. was appeased. But, on the whole, Placci has been difficult and disagreeable this trip. He takes actual pleasure in making people uncomfortable.
We went to Sabbioneta and Parma (Hotel Italie, very good) and then in the afternoon saw *Fontenellato and Borgo San Donino,48 and had tea at Salsomaggiore.
Then we parted. They went on to Modena, and we returned to Milan. Magnagresti was in train.

$$HEADER$$_Saturday, Oct. 7, 1905

Saw churches and took plenty of notes.
Came to Gazzada. Donna Camilla almost cut us in the train and Donna Laura would scarcely speak. What idiotic women! Their idea is that B.B. made up to them for that article Donna L. wrote about him, and that he then threw them over.
Dined at Varese with the Pontes.
$$HEADER$$_Sunday, Oct. 8, 1905

The view is too beautiful! Went in Guido’s motor with Conte Montegazza to Erba to see the Bozzottis and the lady Guido has given his life up to. She is very fat, but lively and attractive. Gropallos still sulky.

Dull day. The conversation here is too dull, I hardly know how to bear it. Late in the afternoon came Mr. and Mrs. Platt who are travelling all through Italy on a motor, taking Perkins along with them. Perkins looked terribly aged and tragic and ill, and was as insufferable as ever. He carries with him an awful “atmosphere”.
$$HEADER$$_Tuesday, Oct. 10, 1905

B.B. wrote to Donna Laura reminding her that when people had reported her as calumniating him, he had not believed it, and he had told her all about it. For answer she summoned him to her and said she believed all the evil she heard of him, and he left her in a rage. Silly woman, he is her last friend. Everyone hates her, and he always stood up for her.
We motored with Don Guido and saw Lugano and Ardenna (where there is nothing) and came to Milan to dine with the Lamberts. 
$$HEADER$$_Wednesday, Oct. 11, 1905

We lunched at the Placcis’ and then went to see some pictures for sale.,

Maud asked to see B.B.’s Pollajuolo53 photographs and I foolishly showed them — foolishly, for she is writing a book in a series edited by Mrs. Strong, whose object is to exploit B.B.’s work without giving him credit, and Miss C.’s other book on Verrocchio54 did this to perfection.
Called on Mrs. Ross.
Rainy.
[p124]
$$HEADER$$_ Monday, Oct. 23, 1905
Mr. and Mrs. Labouchère and the de Rudinis came to lunch. Mrs. L. was most amusing about two men who wore masks and played a street organ, giving out that they were noblemen in disguise, and all the poor women gave them huge sums. “You can’t give 6 p to an “‘Irish Earl’.” Labby said all you saw of them were four red hands like badgers taking the money!
