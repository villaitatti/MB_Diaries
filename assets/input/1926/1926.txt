Our Silver Wedding!

Kenneth Clark
 Starting the year with great anxiety about poor Karin, whose ear is giving her trouble on her voyage to Bermuda. It sometimes seems as if my heart would break over her troubles.
 The others are all well, Alys miraculously, cured of her cancer which first showed itself here just a year ago! Logan here with me, hoping to get cured of his chronic cystitis by a new Germicide sent him by Simon Flexner from the Rockefeller Institute. Ray well and apparently happy, and all the 4 grand children flourishing, except for an occasional temperature of Judith’s - She will soon be here for me to take care of.
 Then Geoffrey, poor old Geoffrey. I know nothing, but I feel he is wretched, and apparently his ladylove, Vita Sackville-West, has got tired of him before he of her, and he has ruined his life here. Logan says that people in London “know” that he and Sybil will divorce.
 Do I care really under my skin for anyone else, except Bernard and Nicky, whom I still have, well and safe? I like lots of people - I am fond of them, but God keep me from caring. Love is potential if not actual pain.

It was only Nicky last night who reminded us that it was our Silver Wedding Day! So we “celebrated” it this evening, with champagne and best wishes for a Golden Wedding. Deaf, blind, ailing, completely old ____ we may be then. 
 BB and I do not regret having married--that is a lot to say. 
 He finished his article on the Antonello fragment of the San Casciano altarpiece which he found at Budapest, and we began to read it with my corrections, this time with only a mildish row. It is, as a matter of fact, better written than usual, so I didn’t have to ___ over it till I was worn to a frazzle. 
 We had Mr and Mrs. Tork to lunch. He is professor of art at Vassar and she is -- deadly. Then BB and Mayer had a walk, and I went with Logan and Kenneth to see the Grand old Lady, Janet Ross. 
 Cecil Pinsent slept on my balcony. He said that if Sybil married Percy L____ --
For whom I infer she means to divorce Geoffrey--
They could not be happy for she can’t adapt herself and Percy has a dangerous temper.

 BB and Alda and Mayer went to Monte Senario and walked. And I took Logan and Kenneth for our “Riveria Walk” over Fiesole, talking of Herbert Home and then to call at Villa Medici, where we found Sybil and Percy drinking tea and waiting for the Sunday visitors. Sybil shrilled on like a cicala and Percy beamed heavily and benevolently. I went up to see this so-called chaperone (who never leaves her room), Miss Keand Trawney.

Miss Rickert brought Mr. and Mrs. Straute to tea - they teach drawing and music at Prince Max’s school in Baden - and she played beautifully on her violin, Bach’s Chaconne and 2 other things by Bach - a great pleasure.
 Placci was feeling Queen Margherita’s illness very much - and she died in the night, as he expected.

 Harold Acton came to lunch -- poor boy, he begins to look like his terribly vulgar father, whom he loathes. But he himself is a nicer, more gifted sort of human being.
 I took Mrs. Ross to call on Lady Enniskillen who told us that poor Harold’s mother has come back with the “last thing” in costume from Paris, stockings to her thighs, no undergarment but a tiny shift, skirts well above the knees, close-shi___ hair, sh___ back from her high forehead, her eyebrows plucked out and replaced with a Japanese effect of black paint.

            Clark
Started at 10 for Prato with Clark and Mayer and Pellegrina and little Cecil Awrep. Saw everything, and there after lunch went to Artemino--that magnificent Villa--are of the big impressions of all Italy. It was interesting and pleasant, but for the great hatred there is between the two boys. In the evening, after Mayer had gone, we asked Clark why he disliked the American boy so much. It is Mayer’s sissy, affected, “____” manners, his gestures, his clownishness. Logan feels the same. And I confess I have noticed it much more since Clark came on the scene. I think Mayer has an “inferiority complex” which leads him to accentuate his American-isms and his differences from Clark. It is unfortunate. BUt as he is able, he will soon have enough merit of his own to stand on, and will not then be cast into confusion by the English Public School manner. 
 Poor old Nicky is in real trouble over BB’S having taken a slightly amorous fancy for Pellegrina. She suffers, but quite needlessly.

 B.B. and I walked - the “inner walk” on the other side, with Pellegrina and Clark. He is keen on coming out, but knows his parents will hate it, as our values (such as they are) have no prestige in their eyes. I said he should not ____ ____ ____ but first say he would “try” a year here, and would learn German and Italian, so that if he did not find it to his liking here he could get into diplomacy, which has prestige for them. He said it would be a ___, but who knows? Everything, except birth and death, and perhaps marriage, is tentative. The unexpected may happen and change the best laid plans.

We started early and saw all the sights, and then after lunch went out to the Cantagallo Villa and crept in by a back gate, encountered the decayed Toschkoff, like father and son, made friends, saw everything, drank some vin santo, and came away much pleased with having seen the beautiful XVIII gardens run down though it is.
 I was amused at the young man who paid no more attention to Pellegrina than if she had been Fausto.

 Nicky in pain all night. Dr. Gigholi came and said it might be appendicitis - and indeed I hope so, it would offer such a comprehensible explanation of her state since 2 years, of fatigue and melancholy and aging, premature aging, which has cast B.B. and me into such despair. It was in Sept. 1923 that suddenly her Radiance disappeared. If it is only appendicitis, it can be dealt with.
 We had a glorious walk to the Tree, Evaline Austen-Saker, Clark, B.B. and I. What a sunset!

Worked on Titian. Kenneth is very intelligent. I took Mrs. Ross to the Cinema “Il Fantasma dell’Opera” but she said, like Queen Victoria, “We are not amused”. 
Di Gigioli came and said he thought Nicky had appendicitis, but wanted further special examination. 
Percy ____ came to dine. It was a bit difficult because Evaline does not mix readily and scarcely understand English and Logan and Percy and Kenneth sat exchanging local and learned remarks. However, it was kind not to town her out to stay for the day in a Florence Pension. She has lost all her money, like the rest of the Baltic Barons, and desperately wants worth, but is too delicate to do any and one feels rather baffled and hopeless. She has turned Catholic--I hope it is a comfort to her.

 It was too cold to keep engagements in town, but Mr. and Mrs. Morris Woolf and their daughter came to lunch. He is a very sensible and nice man. We felt the daughter quite hopeless, with futile art aspirations.
 Mrs. Winty Chanler arrived at 3.30. I had not seen her for 4  years, and she looked older. But later I found her nice face again. Ojetti came to tea and we discussed the origin and permanence of Gothic architecture and what “baroque” came from. No one knew anything about it, nor does anyone really.
 I called on Lina 6.15-7.30, as Aunt Janet would not let her come out in the cold and snow. She is going to London to speak to the Committee of Foreign Affairs about Fascism and Labour. McClure and Cunand and all her  journalist friends in Rome warned her not to take part in a debate on Fascism, if she wanted to come back to Italy!

After lunch with much talk, and, after the naps of the aged, we listened to a “Suite” by Sessions, very modern and discordant, but powerful and of a rhythm that swayed one. Then came Mrs Cabot to tea, very indiscreetly bringing 2 people with her - an ex-opera-singer named Hampson, with amazingly florid manners, and a Madame Bianchi, niece and triagrapher of Emily Dickinson (an American poet), herself “the last expiring wriggle of the Transcendental Movement,” as B.B. described her. Very intense and soulful. She and the barocque [sic] Mr. Hampson are writing a novel together, called “The Eternal Chimera” -- !! After they went, Young Chauler sang some of his very talented “Epigraphs.”

He is in a dreadful state of nerves, but I hope he will get better. I am well (owing to my diet I think) and don’t get too much upset by his rages and follies. 
 In the afternoon I took Mr. Chauler down and went to see Mrs. Cox and Allyn, who has had the fashionable influenza (intestinal) and is not well yet. I renewed our passports and called on Harry Coster’s people.
 B.B. and Kenneth dined with Strong, and we had a quiet evening with Mr. Chanler, who is very nice and loves reading, but a bit muddle-headed. A nice human being, though: but I always get sleepy when with her.

I rang for Elizabeth to pack his things. This brought him round a bit, but it is a long time since he has had such an outburst. And over what? The visit of two charming girls! True, Burke is a burden, and ought not to bring them, but we can’t discredit Nicky and make the poor young man lose face to that extent. It is a storm in a teacup, but I fear it has wrecked B.B.’s health for a week. Poor, poor man!

 “Geoffrey Scott (from someone who knows him well) is in love and anxious to marry.

She was started early in her evil ways by Lady Ottoline, people say, and completely knew __ the traces when quite young. She married one of the worst improprieties of Chelsea, then divorced him and took back her maiden name, and entered on a life of all kinds of vice. Lady Juliet Trevor’s husband set her up for a while in a big house in Portland Place, and she has recently been living with Geoffrey’s friend, Terence Phillips, who got tired of her. Geoffrey took her, and is now wild to marry her, if he can get money enough to marry. Poor fool! He couldn’t have fallen into more awful hands.
 They saw that Percy Lubbock is likely to fall a victim to a well-known trick of Sybil’s, who gets men to love with her on terms of unemotional friendship (non ci credo); then suggests putting the friendship on a more conventional basis by a formal marriage in which everything should go on exactly as before, and then, once married, turns into a passionate and importunate wife!

 Monreale in afternoon. Princess Trabia and Princess Alexandra of Greece joined us. The latter is in love with the Trabia son and he with her, but he has had a ___ for 12 years with the Princess Potenziani and has acknowledged her 2 sons as his and Her husband divorced her for it, but there is no Catholic divorce ___ could not marry him. He is terrified of what she might do if he married this Greek Princess - Suicide, Assassination - at the best horrible scenes. Poor Giulia Trabia is suffering horribly over it.

 I heard from Alys that John Whitall died on the 22nd, after 12 agonizing attacks of angina. He was the beau ideal of my childhood and early girlhood and a very distinguished and elegant person, but quite snuffed out, alas, by his marriage. 
 We spent the morning in San Domenico with De Rinaldi and Ortolani and saw also the Donatello. Michelazzo Tomb at S. Angelo di Nilo. 
 In the afternoon we visited an underground frescoed church and L’Incornata with the beautiful frescoes of Roberto Oderisi. The General Superintendent for the district, Chierici, took us, a nice man, very keen. 
 Dined with Carey and Miss Lawler. There was such loud music that we could not hear each other talk. Horrid.

 Went to S. Chiara, S. Paolo, S. Lorenzo with Ortolani and De Rinaldis. The Nun’s cloister (XVIII) at S. Chiara is a paradise. Fine XIII Tomb in S. Lorenzo. I love the gay theatrical interior of S. Chiara.

 Edith Wharton’s Yacht, the Osprey, came into port, and we went to see them and it at 10:30. Then they all came to the Museum and to lunch with us. Edith and Daisy Chanler, and Logan, and Robert Naten, and his friend Mr. Laurence (Medici pub. house). Also Morra- After a rest we went to Sta. Chiara and the Duomo. They were enchanted with the **Nun’s Cloister.
 At night the full conviction of life after death entered, I won’t say my mind, but my consciousness. I feel it as a Great adventure, very lonely and needing endless character and Awareness and Discipline, but there. There’s no reasoning about it, but it is a wonderful conviction. May I be worthy, and have the chance to repair some of this life’s horrid mistakes!

 Museum with De Rinaldis in morning. Dinner with Morra to Camaldri to tea at the Belvedere. 
 Edith at once thought that Morra was a pretendant for Nicky’s hand. He is a bit epris, I think myself, but I don’t suppose there is any question of marriage even in his mind. Still less in hers. Everybody falls in love with Nicky--comme de raison. 
 Pellegrina wired that she and Giaraien (_____ Paslacci) has decided to enter upon la Vita Nuova. I hope they will be happy.

 NOTE
Letter from Hermann Keyserling to Karin, whom he snubbed and was so rude to before the War. 
Dear Mrs. Steffens--After having had a most successful lecturing-tour in Spain and France, where people have hardly read me, I wonder whether the english, who have read me to an extent, would not like me some day to come over. The fact is that I should like very much to come and visit London between Oct-Jan next, but I can’t do so unless I am asked to come so that, as happen everywhere, my expenses be met by the income from my lectures which are being arranged everywhere in the way concerts are, unless some society owns the necessary funds and machinery to start such things on its own behalf. I have written to several people feeling my ground about it. But I am writing in particular to you, as I hear that you know the younger and more advanced sets, the only ones I am really interested in Would you be so kind as to get the subject of my coming to England started in conversations among your people, and also my willingness to come,  if  I am asked? I would like to go for a fortnight or so and to be in contact during that time with all that stands for life and progress. Please try your best. I am sending you the latest Nouvelles Litéraires. Perhaps the Souvenir von Keyserling by Charles du Bos after having been read by many would make some think that it wouldn't be bad at all to see me once in London as well. The Book of Marriage will be out in an English edition in a few weeks. It is a pity that you didn’t find your way to collaborate.
