		<p>* Sunday, January 1, 1893, Florence </p>
		<p>Read and walked up to San Miniato and enjoyed ourselves. </p>
		<p>We have both read Ranke’s History of the Popes,</p>
		<p> and Bernhard has read Philippson’s History of the Counter Reformation.</p>
		<p> I am hurrying up to learn German so that I can read it, and fill up the intellectual gulf that my ignorance of German creates between us. He has also read Merimée’s novel about Charles IX.</p>

		<p>* Monday, January 2, 1893, Florence </p>
		<p>Read Ibsen’s new play, Master Builder Solness,</p>
		<p> but did not quite see through it. </p>
		<p>Walked and talked and were happy. </p>
