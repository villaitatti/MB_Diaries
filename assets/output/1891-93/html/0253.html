		<p>A day of quarrels, alas! over plans and over the general tendency of children to engulf the personality of the mother, at any rate her intellect.

		<p>Loeser came in completely overcome with a set attack made upon him by Juliet Temple and her chaperon Mrs. Sumner. Juliet is determined to marry him (she told Logan so), but she has too little tact to succeed. He was literally gasping for breath. Mrs. Sumner had evidently played about as creditable part as the “go-between” of a brothel.</p>
