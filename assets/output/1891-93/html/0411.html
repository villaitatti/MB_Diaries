		<p>Wrote home. “Giant” for the children. </p>
		<p>Went to the New Pinacothek and were disgusted.</p>
		<p>> Sunday, August 27, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>I wrote my Hampton Court Guide while the others went to the Bavarian Museum. </p>
		<p>We went to the Schack Gallery after lunch. Really, Lenbach’s copies of Titian are marvellous! </p>
		<p>Hapgood and I went to “Die Feen”</p>
		<p> in the evening. We found it poor, not Wagnerian, and not anything else except spectacular. Fancy fairies without harps!</p>
		<p>Monday, August 28, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Spent the morning over the Italian drawings. After writing a little, we took a lovely walk by the river and back through the park. </p>
		<p>Then, in honour of Goethe, we went to see Iphegenie in Tauris, which was well acted, according to German traditions! </p>
		<p>x Tuesday, August 29, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Drawing again. Wrote “Giant” and Hampton Court Guide. </p>
		<p>Went to hear Tristan and Isolde, my first time, and Bernhard’s sixth. Frau Sucher sang. It surpasses all his other works. </p>
