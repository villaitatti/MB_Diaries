		<p>Rospigliosi and Colonna</p>
		<p> in the morning and Borghese in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>Dead tired again!</p>
		<p>Sunday, May 14, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Spent the day at Tivoli with Miss Bliss, and came home pretty tired.</p>
		<p>Monday, May 15, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Unwell. Went to the Farnesina and Corsini. </p>
		<p>After lunch Bernhard took me to see Donna Laura Minghetti’s wonderful Leonardo (1493) — on the whole, the loveliest picture I have ever seen. </p>
		<p>Then Michael and Field and I went to S. Pietro in Vincoli. The “Moses” overwhelmed us, that horrible “Thou Shalt Not”. </p>
		<p>Then to S. Clemente, S. Stefano Rotondo, S. Pietro Montorio, S. Onofrio and so home. </p>
		<p>Their last volume, A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, came, and we read it and talked much about it. Bernhard advised them to give up Drama and stick to impressions. </p>
		<p>Tuesday, May 16, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>We finished the “Word for Renaissance Churches”.</p>
		<p> Field was most helpful. She has a splendid “thinker” and an equally good “feeler”. </p>
		<p>Went [0399] to the Colonna, while Bernhard called on various people about Lotto. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we went to the Borghese, and in the evening read Browning. </p>
		<p>Wednesday, May 17, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Mother writes that Ray is “sure we could find a buried city if we dug under Friday’s Hill.”</p>
		<p>Bernhard suggested that “Michael Field” should call the second edition of his poems “Revised and decreased”.</p>
		<p>We went to the Sistine, the Stanze, and the Vatican. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we bought photos and walked in the Villa Medici and the ‘bosco’, while Bernhard paid calls. He called on the Countess Suardi</p>
		<p> in the evening while we packed.</p>
		<p>Thursday, May 18, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Went to Albano with Mr. Bliss and a friend of his, Mr. Ryan. We enjoyed every moment, particularly as we sat on the cliff overlooking the Lake of Nemi. Mr. Ryan seemed nice, but when he told me that all he read was Marion Crawford I felt to hate him! </p>
