		<p>Christina and I went to the Uffizi, and Bernhard took old Miss Forbes there. </p>
		<p>After my German lesson we went out to the Certosa, and walked home. On the way I said (one of my rare and infrequent thoughtful remarks!) that methodism is Protestant Jesuitism. </p>
		<p>In the evening we finished Ghosts. </p>
		<p>Wednesday, March 29, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Worked on Lotto in the morning. </p>
		<p>Then Bernhard went to “Vernon Lee’s” to lunch, and met Mr. Benn,</p>
		<p> whom he liked. Mr. Benn said that ‘Americans took a merely feminine interest in ideas’, and he enjoyed Bernhard’s description of Michelet as a person ‘who had only loafer ideas’. </p>
		<p>I met Christina in the Medici Tombs and after lunch we went up to Fiesole where we met Bernhard. We walked again to Settignano. We met a man who had literally fallen on the road with hunger, and helped him to a farm-house and bought him wine and bread, which he devoured greedily, forgetting to thank us, which showed he was not a professional beggar, at least.</p>
		<p>In the evening I read aloud Hedda Gabler. </p>
