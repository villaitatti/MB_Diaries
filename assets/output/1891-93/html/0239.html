		<p>We came over to Siena. The journey took 5 hours, from 9 till 2!</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we walked about the town, and sat in the Cemetery. The first impression of the Piazza is a thing never to be forgotten in any detail. I feel at home with these marvellous views. They remind me of the great stretches of blue mountains and rather bare plain I knew in the West. </p>
		<p>In the evening B. read Layard and I read Là Bas.</p>
		<p>Saturday, March 19, 1892, Siena </p>
		<p>S. Francesco, S. Domenico and the Gallery in the morning. </p>
		<p>After lunch we strolled out and looked at the Raffaelino di Fiorenza (Croli?) of Santa Maria dei [sic] Angeli. </p>
		<p>Then we wandered on and on over the hills, entranced with the view. We had a marvelous view from a high hill opposite. The ways were so winding that it took us twice as long to get home as we expected, and I got rather tired. But a Vermouth and some nice cakes freshened us up. </p>
		<p>I finished Là Bas in the evening, and at half past 8 (!) we dropped asleep from sheer exhaustion. We slept till 6.30.</p>
