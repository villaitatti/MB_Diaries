		<p>London, July 10, 1891. A man was tried at Bow Street. His story was that he had taken as a lodger after his marriage an old friend of his own. This friend seduced his wife, and in a little while the wife, feeling the misery of concealment, [0056] told her husband. Soon after the other man walked by the window as he was coming home to supper. A gun happened to be at hand, and the husband snatched it up and fired, with intent to kill. He succeeded only in seriously wounding him. The jury found the verdict of unlawful wounding, but the Judge let the man go without any penalty, “because”, he said, “in similar circumstances I should have done the same myself.”</p>
		<p>The conversation that followed the recital of this story was curious. The comment of the woman to whom it was told was, “I see women are [0057] still regarded as private property, not as persons in themselves. Of course a man shoots another to defend his house or his purse.” </p>
		<p>“O nowhere but on the Texan frontier” was the reply.</p>
		<p>“Well, the world is only on the Texan frontier as regards women.”</p>
		<p>“The meeting of his old acquaintances is like the precipitation of the two powders that make up a Seidlitz.” </p>
