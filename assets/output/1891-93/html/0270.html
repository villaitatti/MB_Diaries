		<p>San Bartolomeo, San〈to〉 Spirito and San Giovanni, with culminatingly beautiful Lottos. We were adorably happy over them. We saw other churches, including the wonderful Tiepolos in the Colleoni Chapel, and the Lotto intarsias. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we saw the gallery, and had an enchanting walk up to the Castello. </p>
		<p>Worked in the evening. </p>
		<p>* Thursday, May 12, 1892, Bergamo</p>
		<p>After various churches we went to the Gallery. </p>
		<p>After lunch we wrote till 4 when we went to Trescorre to see the Lottos, and then to the Suardi’s other villa to see another Lotto.</p>
		<p>Passed Costa and Frizzoni in the train coming back. </p>
		<p>Finished our 〈Hampton Court〉 Guide in the evening. </p>
		<p>> Friday, May 13, 1892, Milano</p>
		<p>Brera, Poldi-Pezzoli, Borromeo Collection, Tiepolo’s and a Church. </p>
		<p>I was tired but happy. </p>
		<p>We talked to Jens Thiis, Conservateur de la Musée de sculture à Christiana in [0271] the Brera. He hardly knew whether he were on his head or his feet when Bernhard said the Florentines were not Painters. He has a private cult for Botticelli. </p>
		<p>The children arrived at 7.30 and I came away with them at 10.20, leaving Bernhard at the Bella Venezia.</p>
		<p>Saturday, May 14, 1892, Milan, Train to Paris</p>
		<p>An awful day of heat and dust for me. The children enjoyed it. </p>
		<p>I reached Paris at 6.30 and went to Logan’s apartment, 14 rue de la Grande Chaumière. </p>
		<p> At the bottom of a page partially left blank  and marked in blue crayon in the left margin: </p>
		<p>I could not continue a separate journal. It was too dreary being away from Bernhard.</p>
