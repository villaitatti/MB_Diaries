		<p>Went to the Accademia, and I re-discovered Bernhard’s Cariani,</p>
		<p> a puzzling picture called Martino da Udine.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Wrote the Morelli article at intervals all through the day and in the evening. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we went to San Rocco with the two Americans, a Mrs. Sperry and her daughter, millionaires from San Francisco.</p>
		<p> They were not wildly intelligent. </p>
		<p>Then we went to the Frari and afterwards saw the sunset from the Giudecca.</p>
		<p>Monday, October 3, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>I was unwell. </p>
		<p>We met the Sperrys at San Marco and took them to the Redentore, the Scuola di San Giorgio and Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Then, after lunch, we went with them to the Academy. </p>
		<p>Signor Barozzi drew Bernhard into his den and had a chat with him, telling him all about Robert Browning’s Boston friend, Mrs. Bronson, who collected all the newspaper, etc., notices of him after his death, a pile many feet high. She also has the chair he sat [0305] in with a gold chain fastened across it, that no one else may profane the holy resting place!</p>
		<p>After the Academy we went, still with Mrs. and Miss Sperry, to Murano and saw S. Pietro, Santa Maria dei Angeli, and the Duomo. </p>
		<p>I am still on Charles V, and Bernhard is reading Eastlake’s History of Oil Painting.</p>
		<p>x Tuesday, October 4, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>San Giuliano, San Salvador, and Santa Maria Mater Domini, in the morning. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we went back to San Salvador and the sacristan actually took down the horrible affair on the High Altar and we saw the glorious Titian Resurrection. </p>
		<p>Then we went to San Zaccaria and came home and finished the Morelli article. </p>
		<p>In the evening we called for Mrs. Sperry and her daughter and went out on the lagoon in the moonlight. They are a pathetic pair: the old mother fancying she is living for her daughter, dragging her old bones about the Continent to please her, while the daughter feels, “O, if I were only free to go my own way and be with people of my own age, how happy I should be!”</p>
