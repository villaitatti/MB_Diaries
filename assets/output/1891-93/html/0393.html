		<p>A heavenly day, after all the rains. </p>
		<p>We revisited the Signorelli, saw the Cambio</p>
		<p> and saw Bernardino and scrambled about the walls. </p>
		<p>After lunch Bernhard wrote his “Architecture”, being inspired by the fact that the “Nation” has just printed his article on Vasari,</p>
		<p> paying him £6.2/5 for it.</p>
		<p>I finished Manette Salomon.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Then we walked with the Mikes to S. Pietro,</p>
		<p> and round about in the country, getting endless enchanting views. </p>
		<p>After dinner wrote. </p>
		<p>Tuesday, May 2, 1893, Albergo della Posta, Foligno</p>
		<p>We had a wonderful morning at Assisi. </p>
		<p>Then Bernhard and I went to Foligno by train while “M.F.”</p>
		<p> drove to Spello. We met at Spello, and walked out to S. Girolamo, where a nightingale was singing in the wood. Never has there been a more beautiful day. </p>

		<p>Wednesday, May 3, 1893, Hotel Suisse, Rome </p>
		<p>We got up at 4.30 and took the 5.30 train to Spoleto, where we had 4 hours of rapturous enjoyment. </p>
		<p>Then we came here, a hot dusty journey. </p>
