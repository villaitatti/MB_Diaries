		<p>Uffizi and Bargello. Met Loeser and Parry. </p>
		<p>Karin ill, and all the afternoon flew by in doctor and medicine and nursing. Miss Britten called. </p>
		<p>In the evening we finished our Palma, and Bernhard finished Creighton. </p>
		<p>I told Parry that the Arundel Chromes</p>
		<p> are like opera tunes on a barrel organ. I must have taken this from Bernhard, I am sure. He is such a dear! He writes every day for three hours, in spite of the heat and general flabbyness of the weather. </p>
		<p>Thursday, April 7, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Met at 10 at the Uffizi. After a while Mr. Parry joined us, and we looked at many things, chiefly portraits in the Uffizi and in the Pitti. </p>
		<p>Bernhard wrote, while I took care of Karin in the afternoon. Then Parry came and we discussed photographs. His great idea is somehow to wake Oxford up to a real study of the Renaissance. He is a nice boy. </p>
		<p>In the evening we went over and finished our Tintoretto, and read poetry, chiefly Matthew Arnold. </p>
		<p>* Friday, April 8, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>We went to Prato with Parry, and after luncheon drove over to Poggio a Cajano. We missed our train on the way back and drove home. We all enjoyed it very much, and Bernhard and I liked Parry. He is a very “English”, that is to say Protestant, Catholic – very – he even believes in Divorce! And he hates the [0251] Jesuits almost as much as Bernhard does. </p>
		<p>We were pretty tired in the evening.</p>
		<p>Today began the thrice accursed Reign of Fleas! </p>
		<p>It was a keen delight to see the Pontormo at Poggio a Caiano.</p>
		<p>Saturday, April 9, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Finished our catalogue notes at the Uffizi. Then we quarrelled a little, but not seriously. I called on Edith Kendall. </p>
		<p>Nana was dead tired, so I took care of the children in the afternoon, till Mr. Parry came. </p>
		<p>We all three went over photographs, etc., and Mr. Parry, English-wise, began to abuse his relatives, particularly his mother, and his younger brother, who is addicted to gambling. </p>
		<p>The evening was largely taken up with stupid business notes, but (after a quarrel!) we read what Bernhard had written about Tintoretto and Paolo and the Bassani. I found it excellent. </p>
		<p>Gertrude is dreadful. She would be deeply indignant, oh! absolutely outraged, if you said she was not intellectual. </p>
		<p>Here is a list of books she marked as the ones she would like to get from Vieusseux’s:</p>
		<p>Life of Louisa Alcott</p>
		<p>Letters of T. Carlyle and his Wife</p>
		<p>Life of Browning </p>
		<p>English Life thro’ Yankee Eyes</p>
		<p>Florentine Nights, Heine</p>
		<p>True Stories from Italian History, Harrison</p>
		<p>Social Diseases and Worse Remedies, Huxley</p>
		<p>-</p>
		<p>The Lily of the Arno, Johnson Kelly</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Louisa of Prussia</p>
		<p>Life of Edmund Kean</p>
		<p>Vittoria Colonna, Lawley</p>
		<p>Love Letters of Famous Men and Women</p>
		<p>Letters of Mary Shelley</p>
		<p>Lives of 12 Good Men</p>
		<p>Mary Queen of Scots and the Casket Letters</p>
