		<p>Friday, January 1, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Tree for children in morning. Emma taken ill. </p>
		<p>Walked with B. but unfortunately quarrelled — both our faults! </p>
		<p>But I went down to him in the evening and he came to me, and then came back and found me there. </p>
		<p>Saturday, January 2, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Called for B. and went for doctor and nurse in the morning. </p>
		<p>Children very trying in afternoon. </p>
		<p>came in the evening [0185] and we worked on our Titian.</p>
		<p>Every girl ought to be made to spend six months taking care of little children before she marries. She would think twice before having children of her own!! </p>
		<p>The nurse came at 11! </p>
		<p>Children restless all night, and I horribly unhappy at being absent from B.</p>
		<p>Sunday, January 3, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Walked with B. in afternoon. Lovely sunshine but we quarrelled horribly.</p>
		<p>* Monday, January 4, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Uffizi in the morning. Made up our quarrel. </p>
		<p>Worked in evening. </p>
		<p>Tuesday, January 5, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Uffizi. </p>
		<p>Walk. Tea at B.’s. </p>
		<p>B. called at Ways. </p>
		<p>* Wednesday, January 6, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Uffizi. </p>
		<p>Work in evening.</p>
		<p>Thursday, January 7, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Uffizi.</p>
		<p>Went to Ways to dinner. B. very sleepy. Mrs. Way beautifully dressed and [0186] milder in her flirtatiousness than before. She said she and her husband so thoroughly agreed with Mrs. Besant’s book on Population. I am sure if I had asked her which she recommended, the sponge or the syringe, she would have told me, sans gêne! Mr. Way said “It is better to be a pig than a prig,” and B., speaking of the English aristocracy, said it made a great difference whether you belonged to the Peerage or the Beerage. He said the patron Madonna of England is Our Lady of Grundy! </p>
		<p>Friday, January 8, 1892, Florence </p>
