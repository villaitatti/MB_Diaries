		<p>All the rest of the week was spent, by me at least, in sickening for a slight attack of rheumatic fever, trying to walk it off, succumbing to it, and beginning to convalesce. </p>
		<p>We read a good deal of Pater together and went on with the post-Elizabethan poets, a pretty dreary lot between Beaumont and Fletcher and Herrick. </p>
		<p>I read Balzac’s La [sic] Lys dans la Vallée</p>
		<p> and was enchanted by it. After making allowance for his somewhat creaky stage machinery, it is one of the most spontaneous lyric outbursts conceivable. It is awfully true to human nature, too, except that clumsy device of the English horse-woman who contrasts with La Lys in every respect. How touching is the scene where she tries to live and regrets her lost happiness.</p>
		<p>I read Hawthorne’s Italian Notebooks</p>
		<p> and his Marble Faun,</p>
		<p> which [0351] is a mere re-hash of them. Here, set down for once in unblushing print, is The American Traveller, as you still see him, climbing to the top of St Peter’s, pacing halls to find their length, bored to death in the Galleries, yet haunting them, and getting ready to pine without them in America, tyrannized over by his servants, vastly more interested in chance American acquaintances than in all antiquity, discussing ART with everyone — in short, William James!</p>
		<p>During these days of crossness and illness, Bernhard has been studying Botticelli and Perugino, taking long walks. </p>
		<p>Costa and William James came to see me and Loeser sent me flowers.</p>
		<p>Today I read Symonds’ Essays Speculative and Suggestive,</p>
		<p> Vol. I, and some of Eastlake’s Literature of the Fine Arts.</p>
		<p> Symonds has a [0352] fatal fluency. Nothing he says sticks, it is all so glib, so easy, like a “leader” in the daily paper, as easy to read as it is to forget. Eastlake has a fatal common-sense, which accounts for his failure as a writer. People like their art served up with mystery. This common sense will be Bernhard’s ruin, unless the public has more of it than it had in Sir Charles Eastlake’s day. </p>
		<p>I had such a nice letter from dear old Lady Eastlake, really the most delightful old person alive. How she loves Italy. She said, “How glad I am there is a lady who can take up where I left off and pursue the absorbingly interesting road much further and much abler!”</p>
		<p>* Tuesday, February 7, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Worked on Lotto and then met Costa at the Academy and pursued a lively Botticelli argument, Costa wishing to exclude as not [0353] genuine the “Fortezza”, “Judith” and “Adoration” in the Uffizi, and the St. Sebastian of Berlin, and Bernhard claiming, and I think proving, that these are early works. Costa seemed half convinced. </p>
		<p>We had a glorious drive round by Carreggi [sic], Terzollino, Trespiano and the Via Bolognese. Then Bernhard left a card on Sen. Comparetti. </p>
		<p>Mrs. James called on me, and Costa and Bernhard came in before she went. </p>
		<p>Bernhard invented the word “magazining” for hasty reading. </p>
		<p>Prof. Wickhoff</p>
		<p> of Vienna has published two articles in the Journal des Beaux Arts about the Vienna Gallery which are simply the notes he took down of what Bernhard said, even to the aesthetic criticism! The worst of it is he has never mentioned his name. </p>
		<p>Wednesday, February 8, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Work on Lotto and Botticellis in the Uffizi in the morning. After more work, we went out for a walk and picked up Loeser, who seemed to be in poor health. He took us in to have tea at Giacosa’s. He is nice when he doesn’t tell lies, and his ill-health makes him pathetic. </p>
		<p>In the evening Bernhard’s head ached, so I read aloud the Life of Sir Charles Eastlake.</p>
		<p> Born 100 years go, and I know his wife!</p>
