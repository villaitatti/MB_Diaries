		<p>Went to the Gallery in the morning, but I was almost too ill to see anything. However, I enjoyed the Cavazzolas</p>
		<p> while B. studied his problems. </p>
		<p>Lay down the rest of the day, feeling pretty ill. </p>
		<p>B. went to San Stefano, the Duomo, San Siro e Libera, Santa Maria in Organo, Santa Chiara, and San Giovanni in Valle.</p>
		<p>I read Prescott’s Ferdinand and Isabella</p>
		<p> and wrote to Evalyne.</p>
		<p> [an x above the a] </p>
		<p>Went to see fire-works in the Amphitheatre. </p>
		<p>Monday, September 14, 1891, Verona </p>
		<p>Went to San Stefano and studied the Brusasorci frescoes. </p>
		<p>Then to Santa Maria in Organo, where we met the sacristan whom B. liked so much a year and a half ago. He took us in the afternoon out to a church on a hill about 8 kilom〈etres〉 away in a little [121] village called Marcellise. There we discovered four fine Girolamo dei Libris. </p>
		<p>On the way back we stopped at a beautiful round church built by Sanmichele, called La Madonna della Campagna. There was a fine Farinati and some old frescoes inside, but the architecture was more wonderful than all! </p>
		<p>Tuesday, September 15, 1891, Verona</p>

		<p>Went to San Lorenzo and Santi Apostoli and to San Fermo. </p>
