		<p>Came from The Hague here. Read Motley. </p>
		<p>Went to Museum. Saw “Night Watch” B.B. said it was a poet’s attempt to translate a commonplace subject into verse, and that it was told better and more appropriately, on the whole, in the good prose of Van du Helst, Jardin, etc. </p>
		<p>Saw a Vermeer von Delft and other Rembrandts and Franz Hals. </p>
		<p>Very tired. </p>
		<p>Read more Motley. </p>
