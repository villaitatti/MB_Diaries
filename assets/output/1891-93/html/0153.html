		<p>What happiness to wake up in such a place! For once the early church bells were enchanting – and we got up early and saw the gleam of dawn strike on the distant campanile – almost as graceful as St. Mark’s, and on the square tower with the baroque cupola, which “defying all laws of propriety” makes its chief beauty, on the blue green moat around the old wall, reflecting the towns, and on the statue of the young Giorgione himself who stands on a little island in the moat, his pencil and book always in his hand, a gay young cavalier, in fashionable clothes. If the statue were as beautiful as its surroundings, it would leave nothing to be desired. Even as it is, the poetry [0154] that Giorgione casts over everything, near and far, that in any way touches him, has not left his statue bare of charm. The place itself is even more ‘Giorgionesque’ than Bassano is ‘Bassanesque’. Everywhere beautiful peasants, with something of the charm of his faces, the simple square towers he loved to paint, the wide stretches of sky and tender trees against it. Brought up in such a simple, beautiful town, his eye was trained to love simple lines of architecture, and what a blessing for the whole train of his followers. </p>
		<p>Later we spent an hour and a half with [0155] the Madonna, on a ladder, with a good light. How I enjoyed it! Unromantic as it sounds, I enjoyed her red robe falling across her lap, and her green tunic, the most of everything in the picture! They are not repainted at all, and how beautiful the lines of the drapery are, like the clear, nervous lines of sensitive orchid petals.</p>
		<p>Then we went to Treviso and spent most of the afternoon in front of the Savoldo alter-piece in San Niccolo. We also got a glimpse of the Titian and Pordenone in the Duomo. </p>
		<p>I was ill from the Rovigo poisoning, but I enjoyed myself. </p>
