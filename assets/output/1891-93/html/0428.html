		<p>Missed the train to Medole, so spent a delightful day seeing the churches. </p>
		<p>At S. Clemente we got into a quarrel with the custode and the parroco, and at the end came to mutual vituperation. “Senza Creanza” was the last word hurled at us as we disappeared round the corner.</p>
		<p>Bernhard read Il Cortigiano</p>
		<p> and I wrote in the evening. </p>
		<p>Found bianca riviera an excellent white wine. </p>
		<p>Friday, November 3, 1893, Brescia</p>
		<p>Spent 2 1/4 hours going to Medole,</p>
		<p> five minutes look at the fine Titian there, and 2 1/4 hours coming back!</p>
		<p>I read Modern Painters</p>
		<p> and Bernhard the Cortigiano. </p>
		<p>Found the Café Centrale a good place to eat at, after having been driven from all the other places by overcharges or bad service. This place very cheap, clean, and quiet. </p>
		<p>Went to Paitone</p>
		<p> in the afternoon, and rushed up to the Santuario to see the wonderful Moretto.</p>
		<p> Bernhard had a sort of heart attack from hurrying. </p>
		<p>Dined at cafe. Sussago rosso (vecchio) a splendid red wine.</p>
		<p>Wrote an article in the evening about the day’s adventure. </p>
		<p>* Saturday, November 4, 1893, 〈Albergo〉 Roma, Cremona</p>
		<p>Saw all the rest of the Churches. </p>
		<p>Came here. Found many letters and the proofs. As usual disquieting news from London, not about the children, but about B.F.C.C.’s hostility. </p>
		<p>“Michael Field’s” play A Question of Memory seems to have been a failure. Logan saw it. Wrote that they revilled [sic] in scenes and incidents which he was [0429] sure Reigate</p>
		<p> could not afford. That is what kills them to be so far from life. </p>
		<p>Sent off my article. </p>
		<p>Sunday, * Monday, Tuesday, November 5-7, 1893,  Cremona, Roma (a continuous fog)</p>
		<p>Saw the Churches and pictures as best we could. Felt somewhat depressed. </p>
		<p>Bernhard’s article on Architecture in the Free Review arrived.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, November 8, 1893, Croce Bianca, Parma</p>
		<p>Came here in a pour. Trailed about and saw things. </p>
		<p>Thursday, November 9, 1893, Parma</p>
		<p>Still pouring. </p>
		<p>Saw the Correggios and the Gallery. </p>
		<p>Finished my Hampton Court Guide. </p>
		<p>Bernhard finished Il Cortigiano.</p>
		<p>Friday, November 10, 1893, 〈Albergo〉 Pellegrino, Bologna</p>
		<p>You are old, Father William, the young man said, </p>
		<p>For your hair has become very thin</p>
		<p>And when anything new is presented to view,</p>
		<p>You only say ‘Well, I’m agin’ ”</p>
		<p>We saw the wonderful Convent Parlour at Parma and came on here in a pouring rain. </p>
		<p>Saturday, November 11, 1893, Bologna</p>
		<p>St. Petronio and Giovanni in Monte, in the morning. </p>
		<p>Gallery in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>I wrote a review of Luzio and Renier’s Mantova e Urbino and sent it to the Chronicle. </p>
		<p>Bernhard reading Diderot’s Pensées philosophiques,</p>
		<p> etc. </p>
		<p>Sunday, November 12, 1893, Bologna</p>
		<p>Saw the medals, etc., in the Museo Civico, also several churches. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon Bernhard walked to S. Lucca [sic]</p>
		<p> and I wrote my “Assisi” of last year for the Outlook. </p>
		<p>Talked with a girl in the evening named May Jeffrey. </p>
		<p>At the bottom of the page, written upside down:</p>
		<p>Wake! For the Sun who scattered into flight</p>
		<p>The Stars before him on the Field of Night.</p>
