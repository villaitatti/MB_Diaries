		<p>Went to the gallery in the morning and called on two of the directors. Herr Frümel was a pleasant little man, embarrassing in his shyness, but very kind and helpful. He spoke excellent literary French, rather slowly, as if he were turning over the leaves of the dictionary in his head. </p>
		<p>We saw an unexposed picture, a large Adoration of the Magi, by Jacopo and his son Francesco Bassano. </p>
		<p>In the evening we quarrelled because B. wouldn’t write, but finally we began an article on the galleries in the smaller towns near Vienna. </p>
		<p>Thursday, November 26, 1891, Vienna</p>
		<p>Called again on Herr Frümel and saw some of the lower rooms. A beautiful small relief by Moderna pleased me more than can be expressed. </p>
		<p>After a “Thanksgiving Turkey” B. and I went again to the Gallery. </p>
		<p>In the evening, after Janet had been to tea, we wrote about the Venetian pictures in the Gallery. </p>
