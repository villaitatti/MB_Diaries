		<p>Tried to re-write Correggio article. </p>
		<p>Sunday, September 6, 1891, Hotel Roth, Munich</p>
		<p>Went to the Pinacothek and studied and noted the Venetian and Veronese paintings. </p>
		<p>Visited the various Brauereis in the evening, but they were so smoky that even the music did not tempt us to stay. </p>
		<p>As it was a Volksfest, a cold rain was falling all day. God is evidently as undemocratic here as in England! </p>
