		<p>Went early to gallery and went carefully through the Venetian School from Gentile da Fabriano and Antonio Vivarini to Tiepolo. Also the Veronese school. </p>
		<p>Thursday, August 20, 1891, Berlin</p>
		<p>Florentine School at the gallery. </p>
		<p>As we were looking at a fake “Pisanello”, an American young man asked why it was fake. We were too busy to stop, but we asked him to lunch. H〈e〉 turned out to be from New Brunswick, and his name was Van Dyck, a circumstance which naturally led him to take [0094] an interest in pictures!! He had rather good taste, but he was oppressed with profound scepticism. He said that the pictures were all so repainted that the ascriptions were a mere matter of guess-work. In fine, he turned out to be the sort of person who knows too much to want to learn, and too little to teach, or even to sympathize.</p>
		<p>Went to the Nationalgallerei.</p>
		<p>Herr Klinsmann dined with us and we walked in the Thiergarten. We discussed the Jews in Berlin. </p>
		<p>Friday, August 21, 1891, Berlin</p>
		<p>Ferrarese and Milanese Schools at the Gallery. Went to museum upstairs and [0095] Tschudi’s study. </p>
		<p>Herr Klinsmann took us to the International Exhibition, where there were paintings by every school but the only good one, the French. Böcklin had an absurd ‘Susanna and the Elders’, as modern old ___ Jews. Berenson said he would like to see the Bible illustrated by Böcklin. The Spanish painters struck me as delightful, particularly Villegas and Beuliure y Gil.</p>
