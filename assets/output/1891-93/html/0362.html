		<p>Lotto, Bargello, German, while Bernhard called on Costa.</p>
		<p>He found at the National Library that The Nation had printed his Stillman letter, with the information that it closed the controversy — as indeed it did. Loeser came to Costa’s and congratulated Bernhard upon it, but with a manner and look which betrayed that he felt very sick over it, and would give anything if Stillman had only had the best of it. </p>
		<p>After some more Lotto, I called on Lady Carly〈s〉le, who kept me a long time. I enjoyed it, as she asked me many questions about my studies. On the whole, in spite of her belief that I have a strong natural vocation for politics, I think I convinced her that I was not idle, nor likely to be a mere dead weight in the world. </p>
		<p>In the evening we did some more Lotto and read Pater’s Winckelman〈n〉,</p>
		<p> a rather disconnected affair — full of good things however.</p>
