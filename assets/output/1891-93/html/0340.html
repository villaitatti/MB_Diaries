		<p>Despair. It is so hard to do anything which points towards giving up Ray, yet my position becomes worse each day. I live on in semi-concealment. </p>
		<p>* Thursday, January 12, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>At last Bernhard gave me the choice between retaining Ray at all costs or sticking honourably to him. It is true, it would be absurd to pay for a more than doubtful share in Ray, our whole happiness. Yet the thought of really giving her up, cut my brain literally like a knife. I never suffered such sharp pain. Of course I decided for Bernhard, and now I mean to do all I can to improve our position. </p>
		<p>Friday, January 13, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>I wrote to mother to let everyone know about [0341] my separation from B.F.C.C. so that it may come from my side, and not be concealed as if we were ashamed of it. </p>
		<p>Read Ranke and Perry and Huysmans’ Sac au Dos.</p>
		<p>Lunched with Loeser and walked over Bellosguardo. </p>
		<p>x Saturday, January 14, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Went over sculpture, etc., photographs in the morning. </p>
		<p>Walked in the Cascine in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>Read poetry of Charles d’Orleans, Perry, Ranke. </p>
		<p>Bernhard has just finished Morley’s Diderot,</p>
		<p> and is reading Voltaire</p>
		<p> and Tristram Shandy.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Mrs. James, Loeser told us, had kept his dinner party waiting half an hour because the dressmaker had not sent home her “body” in time. The “body” turned out to be a red cashmere blouse. She told me that she longed to get back to Cambridge to set up a small chicken farm. </p>
		<p>Walking in the Cascine we composed this [0342] rondeau:</p>
		<p>Mrs. James</p>
		<p>How she flames</p>
		<p>In a “body”</p>
		<p>Red and shoddy</p>
		<p>She hates Florence</p>
		<p>In abhorrence</p>
		<p>For her chickens </p>
		<p>Her heart sickens</p>
		<p>In a “body”</p>
		<p>Red and shoddy</p>
		<p>How she flames</p>
		<p>Mrs. James!</p>
		<p>x Sunday, January 15, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>We rather wasted the morning doing odds and ends, at least I did. Bernhard read Voltaire. </p>
		<p>We walked to the Indian after lunch. </p>
		<p>I finished Vol. I of Ranke’s History of France</p>
		<p> and read Merimée’s Chronique de Charles IX,</p>
		<p> and studied German. </p>
		<p>Bernhard went to the Forbes in the evening, but was bored. </p>
		<p>Monday, January 16, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Read. Went to Uffizi. </p>
		<p>Walked in Cascine.</p>
