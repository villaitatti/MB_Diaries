		<p>Alas! Alas! I must go away today. Please, sweet Bernhard, be happy while I am gone. I hate to leave here.</p>
		<p>We corrected the article on Potapenko in the morning and began another. Bernhard was mean enough to have an idea deeper than any we had put into my article, explaining in fact half of what I said! So he began to work that out.</p>
		<p>After lunch we looked over the Lottos and Crivellis and read and packed and entered the dates of Vienna and the National Gallery into our Quadri.</p>
		<p>O happy, peaceful intellectual life! How I hate to go away. But I must go at 9.30 and it is now 9.</p>

		<p>Four weeks of London fog, but Ray was enchanting. </p>
		<p>Home was like Hell, father tormenting everybody and everybody deceiving him. </p>
		<p>Burke came to spend 10 days with Bernhard and was delightful. He bought [0335] Gagliardiâ€™s Pier di Cosimo. Bernhard says he is one of the profoundest thinkers of our generation. </p>
		<p>I saw the Mikes and they were so comforting and sympathetic. </p>
		<p>I spent Thursday in Paris with Maude, and reached here at 6.40 this evening. </p>
		<p>I went to the Brera in the morning, between trains.</p>
		<p>We were so glad to see each other that is it no use speaking of it! </p>
