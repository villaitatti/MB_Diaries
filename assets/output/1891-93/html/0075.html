		<p>After lunch went to the Cathedral to see Rubens and to S. Jacques, where there is a finer Rubens.

		<p>Paul Potter, Bull. This is a wonderful picture, painted to be the exact texture of the skin of the different animals. [0077] A paradox in paint, for, although it is exactly like, the effect is not al all as we see it. P.P. died before 30. Interesting speculation as to what he might have become, with this wonderful skill with the brush. </p>
		<p>Saw Italian pictures. </p>
