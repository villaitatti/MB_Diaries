		<p>Thursday, January 28, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Academy and Churches in the morning. </p>
		<p>Walked in the afternoon, called on Gertrude, who was horribly ill and nervous. </p>
		<p>Took tea with B. at Loeser’s.</p>
		<p>Friday, January 29, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Wrote to the Michael Field’s and copied B.’s criticism of Huysmans’ À Rebours. </p>
		<p>Studied all the Filippo Lippi’s. Tea together and a walk. </p>
		<p>Saturday, January 30, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Went to Prato by the 10 o’clock steam tram. Saw the Gaddi’s, etc., in San Francesco, also the frescoes in the Duomo and the Gallery. </p>
		<p>Then went to the wonderful little Church by Giuliano di San Gallo 〈in Prato〉, which was more overwhelmingly beautiful than ever. We had tea together and then a little walk. </p>
		<p>In the evening we dined at Loeser’s with [0198] Mrs, Way, who was as bête as ever, even more so. This was such a dreadful aside for a dinner party of four –– ! </p>
		<p>“Why do you like caviar?” </p>
		<p>B. Parce que ça me remous jusqu’au fond de mon estomac.”</p>
		<p>“Ah” a sigh and a very meaning look. “Comment est-ce-que vous sentez là?” … (silence) … “Dites. Moi! Comment est-ce-que vous sentez là - je voudriez tellement savoir!!” </p>
		<p>It only left to be supposed that she wished the natural reply, “Voulez-vous essayer, Madame?”, which however was not forthcoming.</p>
		<p>Loeser, too, was impossible. He compared Lemaître’s Mariage blanc to Ibsen! – !</p>
		<p>* Sunday, January 31, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Read Vasari’s life of Benozzo Gozzoli. </p>
		<p>B. went to see Loeser’s reputed Pontormos in the Uffizi. Evidently L. did not know the difference between Agnolo and Alessandro [0199] Bronzino. </p>
		<p>I called on Gertrude, who was better. </p>
		<p>Had tea with B. Felt cross, but he was so dear and sweet and entertaining that it was melted out of me.</p>
		<p>Quant’è bello giovinezza</p>
		<p>Che si fugge tuttavia</p>
		<p>Chi vuol esser lieto, sia,</p>
		<p>Di doman’ non c’è certezza.</p>
		<p>Wrote to Edith 〈Kendall? Carpenter?〉 in the evening and studied Italian.</p>
		<p>Monday, February 1, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>A glorious spring day! </p>
		<p>Took mother and the children to the cloister of Santa Maria Novella, and then B. and I went to S. Apollonia and S. Egidio to see Andrea del Castagna. [sic] </p>
		<p>After my Italian lesson we walked to Certosa. </p>
		<p>B. lunched with Loeser who talked much about his former mistress, an actress in Germany. He said he could never love her ‘because owing to the birth of a child (not his) her vagina was too large for him. He said it would be a terrible tragedy all through her life – – – – !! </p>
		<p>B. called on Mrs. [0200] Way in the evening who reproached him with ‘enjoying her with only two of his senses, sight and hearing.’ She said she could easily fall in love with him. To her all life is wasted that is not spent in sexual love, but she has been stupid enough to idealize it beyond the limits set by nature, to dream of it as something which is to satisfy her being entirely. Naturally her husband (who is charming) fails to meet the claims of this Ideal, and she seems frankly to be on the look-out for some one else. She thought she had found it in B. and she is rather puzzled that he does not respond, and can only explain it by thinking that his continual brain-work has ‘atrophied what makes him most really a Man.’ It is a pity she cannot fall in love with Loeser, they would make an admirable pair, or no, they would not, for he pretends to be intellectual, and she has no pretence to be anything but sensual, [0201] except sentimental, perhaps. She thinks women ought to die at 45! I wonder if she will feel so when she attains that age. She will be simply awful at 35, unless she is too conventional and cowardly. </p>
		<p>* Tuesday, February 2, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Saw the Alessio Baldovinettis in the morning (at the tomb of the Rucellai) and Santa Annunziata and the frescoes at San Minato, in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>The rain has come on again. </p>
		<p>Grandma told Karin today that it was not “genteel” to talk of the smell of things you were eating. Karin replied, with admirable impudence, “We talk about whatever we like to talk about.”</p>
		<p>Read several volumes of Maupassant’s short stories, and Burckhardt. B. read Perry’s Greek Literature.</p>
		<p>* 〈Wednes〉day, February 3, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Saw the Alessio Baldovinetti at San Niccolò. </p>
		<p>Then at the Uffizi studied him and Domenico Veneziano and the Polaijuoli and Loeser’s famous false Pontormios. </p>
		<p>Musgrave called on me. [0202] We had a nice walk round by Gertrude’s. Gertrude did not enjoy Sense and Sensibility! She could “hardly wade through it”, and thought it dreadfully uninteresting compared to Shirley.</p>
		<p>Mrs. Way enjoyed most the story of Maupassant’s called Imprudence in which, after making her husband describe his hundred odd mistresses, the wife begins to think that she might perhaps enjoy a variety of men. </p>
		<p>I read Sense and Sensibility and Burckhardt. </p>
		<p>〈Thurs〉day, February 4, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>I took mother to Prato to see Giuliano di San Gallo’s Church, which she wanted to see, as being the most beautiful Church of the Renaissance. She was disappointed at first, but it grew upon her. It took her a long time to enjoy the frieze because garlands were the old-fashioned, stupid thing, when she was at the age of caring about pretty things — an age so [0203] many people quickly outgrow! So she instinctively hates garlands, and feels as if they couldn’t be really artistic, because her grandmother used to arrange flowers in garlands. </p>
		<p>When I came back I had tea with B. and we took a walk. </p>
		<p>He and Musgrave came to dinner, and M. read us his really excellent translation of Dante, a great improvement upon the preceding translation. His elocutionary way of reading it almost spoiled it unfortunately, and he anticipated all our compliments by exclaiming himself, “What beautiful poetry!” “What subtle rhymes.” “What music in this line”, etc., etc. </p>
		<p>I was dishonest about my supposed “teetotalism”, partly from cowardice, but much more from the kindly desire to spare her pain, poor mother, whose universe is founded on the principle, “It is wicked to drink”, although she eats zabaiones!</p>
