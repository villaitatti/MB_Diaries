		<p>“Any sacrifice is better than bringing a scandal upon your children. I wish thee to realize how precious thy interests are to all of us. Thee does not stand alone, thee cannot think of thy own wishes alone. We are all dependent on thee, and most of all thy little children. We will stand by thee, my child. I will make any sacrifice for thee. We all feel for thee most keenly, we do not blame them, we wish for thy ultimate happiness as much as thee can wish for it thyself. I am prepared to make [0068] thy life and thy children’s easy, to make thee independent of thy husband, but I cannot think thee would feel it right to act in such a way as to cause any scandal. Of course, as my daughter, I trust thee to act honourably, but thee is rash and headstrong and selfish, and I dread the consequences of thy impetuosity. When it was too late, thee would regret it.</p>
		<p>Now, my daughter, I have been quite frank with thee, and I am sure thee will not kill thy parents in their old age with anxiety and trouble, and that thee will not cast a cloud over the lives of [0069] thy children, or irretrievably wreck thy husband’s career. I love thee most tenderly, we all so, and I want thy good.”</p>
		<p>“Thank thee, father. I will think over all thee has said. I will go now, as they will be returning from Church.” (opens door)</p>
		<p>“Now, dear, thee will make some sacrifices for us, will thee not?”</p>
		<p>“I have no doubt I will make some sacrifices, a good many, but no one has my life to live except myself.” (goes out)</p>
