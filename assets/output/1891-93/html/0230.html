		<p>We went to the Palazzo Vecchio this morning and had a look all round. The Salviatis and Vasaris were awful. But to make up for all, we came at the end upon a wonderful little chapel, the private chapel of Eleanora of Toledo, decorated with marvellous frescoes by Bronzino. One of them, the drowning Pharaoh’s army in the Red Sea, had as wonderful a stretch of sunset coloured water as even Besnard could have painted! It reminded us both of Besnard. The figures, too were drawn with his delicious precision, that gives one such a sense of completeness. There is no hesitation, nothing tentative about him. What he undertakes to do, he carries through perfectly.</p>
		<p>Then we went to the Badia, and then to the Uffizi, where we met Costa, with whom we walked back. </p>
		<p>I had an Italian lesson. </p>
		<p>Then the little Foote boy, and Arnold and Harold and Yvonne came, so that there was a merry party of children.</p>
		<p>Then I went to B.’s where we had tea with Mr. and Mrs. Adams and Mr. Jenkins. Deadly! </p>
		<p>In the evening I wrote my story and B. read Creighton. </p>
