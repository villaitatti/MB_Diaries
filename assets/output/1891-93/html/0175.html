		<p>Breakfast together. </p>

		<p>In the evening we read Ruskin’s Ariadne Fiorentina, a book about engravings of Botticelli’s, chiefly done by tenth rate imitators of the people Ruskin detests most on earth – the Polaignoli!! [sic] He speaks of the Primavera and the Venus as tondos! and mixes up Mantegna and Castagno! </p>
