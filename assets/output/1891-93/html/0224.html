		<p>We took our Perugino photographs and went to see all the Perugino’s here, including the Cenacola attributed to Raphael, which Morelli attributed to Manni. It is clearly, clearly a Perugino, however. </p>
		<p>I took Gertrude a selection of photographs in the afternoon. She seemed worse. </p>
		<p>In the evening I had a terrible headache. B. was so sweet and nice; he sat by the fire and chatted gently, till he drove my head-ache almost away. </p>
		<p>We sent the Michael Fields his essay on the ‘struggle of the individual’ in literature.</p>
		<p>Monday, March 7, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>We went to the Uffizi in the morning. It was bitterly cold. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we grappled with something about Art which B. wrote last night. </p>
		<p>It is one of our special anniversaries today. A year ago we were at Haslemere. Florence Ayling was there too. What a dreadful year, yet how happy I have been. One could not pay too dear for such joy.</p>
		<p>Emma said today, when Karin took a long nap and did not get her dinner till 4, [0225] that she looked at her and thought, “Dining at quality hours!” What an expression!! O Life! That such things should rise naturally to anyone’s lips!</p>
		<p>B. said that the cult of the Magdalen came in with the Jesuits, a very fruitful subject for thought. </p>
