		<p>We met at 4 o’clock and were very happy. </p>
		<p>x Saturday, June 11, 1892, 14 rue de la Grande Chaumière, Paris </p>
		<p>We saw the cathedral and several churches 〈in Amiens〉 and then the delightful decorations of the Musée by Puvis de Chavannes. These we enjoyed beyond words. We took the afternoon train for Paris. </p>
		<p>Bernhard brought his friend Maude</p>
		<p> to see me in the evening. She was very sweet and sympathetic and we loved each other at once.</p>
		<p>x Sunday, June 12, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>Went with Maude to the collection Petit, where we saw many works of the Barbizon school, a Manet, a Moroni, a Guardi, some Rubens, 2 Frans Hals, a Terburgh,</p>
		<p> etc.</p>
		<p>Went to the Salon after lunch, and especially enjoyed Richemond and Collin. </p>
		<p>In the evening we dined with Maude and her sisters. American-wise, the conversation was broken into interrupted [0273] tête-à-tête. </p>
		<p>* Monday, June 13, 1892, Paris </p>
		<p>I went to see Carey Thomas, and then we met at the New Salon.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we met Maude and went through Durand-Ruel’s astonishing private collection of pictures by Manet, Monet, Pissaro, [sic] Sisley, etc. The Manet dancing scene was especially wonderful.</p>
		<p>Maude came to spend the night. </p>
		<p>x Tuesday, June 14, 1892, Paris </p>
		<p>Went early to the New Salon, and shamelessly “got it up.” Carey and Mamie Gwinn came at 10 and I took them round.</p>
		<p>Maude in the evening. </p>
		<p>* Wednesday, June 15, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>Louvre. New Salon. </p>
		<p>Maude to dine, and the Troyens in the evening. What beautiful music. </p>
		<p> Thursday, June 16, 1892, Paris </p>
		<p>Pictures, I forget what. </p>
		<p>Dined with Carey who read and liked the manuscript of “The Venetian School.” </p>
		<p>Mr. Burke arrived.</p>
