		<p>Went to the Albertina in the morning and while B. and Costa took notes on the Italian pictures exposed, I looked at the Dürers.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we walked, and in the evening went to the Burgtheater to see Ibsen’s Fest auf Solhaug. It is one of the most charmingly poetic things I ever read, all the way through like a single simple but kinder ballad. It was acted as only Germans can act tragedy! ———!! B. said he used to blame the German actors, but now he sees it is the German public who heave atrociously bad taste, and he goes as to a Chinese theatre for a study of local taste, not for enjoyment of art. I believe they excel in comedy, and indeed the only part in this play well done was the semi-buffoon of a husband.</p>
