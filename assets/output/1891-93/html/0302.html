		<p>Saw the Loschi Giorgione, Christ bearing Cross, repainted but unmistakable. </p>

		<p>[insert plan] </p>
		<p>a Palladian building of one story and attics, a summer villa, with its small rooms decorated in fresco by Tiepolo, with the nearest approach to genre he could get. Louis XV, minuette genre, deliciously human and sympathetic even if fashionable. In some scenes he was very close to Longhi. </p>
		<p>The other villa at the end of the garden was filled with his frescoes too, the story of Dido, gods and goddesses, etc. The brush work in places was not unlike Besnard. </p>
