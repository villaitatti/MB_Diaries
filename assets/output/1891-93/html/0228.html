		<p>Pitti in the morning, and further arrangement of B.’s photographs. </p>
		<p>After lunch B. called on Gertrude while I wrote my story. Then I took Ray to call upon the Footes, while B. went to call upon a disconsolate honeymoon couple named Adams, who have been married a fortnight and are nearly bored to death. </p>
		<p>[marginal note: ‘They separated for good a few months later.’]</p>
		<p>Why will Americans always talk about oysters and sweet potatoes and things to eat in general? My Americans appeared to travel from table d’hôte to table d’hôte, chiefly for the purpose of proving that no place is so comfortable as America. Well, they are welcome to go back and welter in it! </p>
		<p>Then I went to see Gertrude for a little while. </p>
		<p>In the evening we wrote our Lotto.</p>
		<p>* Monday, March 14, 1892, The King’s Birthday, Florence</p>
		<p>Being a popular holiday, with the Galleries closed, of course it poured. We arranged photos, all the morning. </p>
		<p>Loeser came in. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we had a walk. Were too tired in the evening to do much, so I read and finished My Trivial Life and Misfortune,</p>
		<p> and B. went on with Creighton. He is reading Huysmans’ La Bas.</p>

		<p>It is strange how little most “serious” people think about l’art de vivre. Truly it is a most difficult art. How rare are [0229] the successes. Yet when we grow old, we won’t look back upon our famous books, on the flattery we have had, but to our early loves, to our real enjoyments, perhaps after those in which the intellect has had little part. I shall never forget the charm of these days, not only for the awakening of my intellect, delightful as it is to begin to think freely, but because Bernhard looked in such and such a way, and spoke in sweet, deep tones, and because Ray came every evening and laid her selfish little head against my knees, while I read the Wonder Book to her. Ah! How happy, happy I am. Truly this is a marvellous year. There is only one cloud, and that is that in spite of our promises, we never seem to work upon our Hampton Court Guide. We planned to do so much this winter, and Bernhard has often promised he would have it ready for me to take back to London when I go, but I doubt it. Alas! it will make everything much, much harder for me. Still I could bear that well enough it I were really convinced that it is not worth spending time over, but I am not convinced of that. </p>
