		<p>Last look at Gallery. </p>
		<p>Bernhard found “Vernon Lee’s” card. We must have seen her in the Gallery, a fright, but seeming rather intelligent about the pictures. </p>
		<p>I found a letter from Lady Eastlake. </p>
		<p>We came to Genoa, hoping to find an Esposizione di Quadri Antichi to repay us. </p>
		<p>Monday, September 26, 1892, Genoa </p>
		<p>Went to the Brignole-Sale Gallery and found some Paris Bordones. Saw the Municipio. </p>
		<p>Met Signor Barozzi of Venice at the Esposizione. We found very few things there to reward our journey, perhaps a portrait by Bartolommeo Veneto was the only other thing we would not naturally have seen whenever we came here.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon I wrote to Mr. Arford, my solicitor, sending him some questions for Counsel’s opinion. </p>
		<p>Then we went to the Palazzo Marcelli-Durazzo, and found nothing, but a fine stair-case and Guidos and Reubens, etc.</p>
		<p>Then to the Balbi-Senegara and found an overwhelming Titian, marvellously beautiful, worth any journey! </p>
		<p>Afterwards we saw the sunset from the town of S. Maria di Carignano. </p>
		<p>Wrote in evening. Read Charles V.</p>
