		<p>Gallery in the morning. </p>
		<p>Wrote and walked in the afternoon.</p>
		<p>Thursday, August 31, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Somehow I have skipped a date and it is the 31st. I don’t understand it! The programme of the day was as usual. </p>
		<p>Friday, September 1, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Stayed in and wrote “Giant” and Hampton Court Guide. </p>
		<p>Went to hear Tannhäuser which we enjoyed immensely, rather to our surprise. It is a very generous young work. He didn’t economize themes and situations. </p>
		<p>Saturday, September 2, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Gallery, walked, and wrote as usual. </p>
		<p>Sunday, September 3, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Eight years ago was my marriage-day, alas! </p>
		<p>We tried to go to Schleis〈s〉heim,</p>
		<p> but the train stopped running Sept. 1. So we went to the Gallery. </p>
		<p>After writing and a walk we heard Das Rheingold [0413] the shortest and most crowded full of music of all the Ring. It was well given and we enjoyed it. </p>
		<p>* Monday, September 4, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Gallery and writing. </p>
		<p>Berenson said that Hapgood differed from most Americans in being willing to accept a truth when he saw it, without regard to God, the American Eagle, or any other abstractions. </p>
		<p>* Tuesday, September 5, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Gallery, writing and reading. A long walk.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, September 6, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>The New Gallery. </p>
		<p>Called on Mr. Bush.</p>
		<p>Writing, etc. </p>
		<p>Thursday, September 7, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Maude Mosher’s and John Robertson’s wedding day. I wonder how soon they will be separated or divorced?</p>
		<p>We carried out our usual programme.</p>
		<p>x Friday, September 8, 1893, Munich</p>
		<p>Went to the Panorama of Rome. </p>
		<p>Heard “Götterdämmerung” in the evening. I was perfectly delighted with it, and felt that I would gladly hear all the Ring over again. </p>
		<p>Saturday, September 9, 1893, Café Central, Innsbruck</p>
		<p>Came here by the 11.28. Read Ranke. </p>
		<p>We had a [0414] dreadful time finding rooms, for the town is crowded, and has been since June 4, with a Fair. One hotel keeper said he could not give us 3 single rooms, but he could give us one room with 3 beds! That man deserves to succeed in his business!!! </p>
		<p> Sunday, September 10, 1893, * Hotel d’Ampezzo, Toblach</p>
		<p>Saw the Gallery, etc. Came here.</p>
		<p>[TRENTINO - ALTO ADIGE - VENETO]</p>
		<p>Monday, September 11, 1893, * Aquila Nera, Cortina</p>
		<p>Diligence to Schluderbach. Then we walked through the Dolomites here, about 15/16 miles. We enjoyed every step of the way, all three of us. It was a thoroughly delightful day. </p>
		<p>Tuesday, September 12, 1893, Hotel Venezia, Pieve di Cadore </p>
		<p>Diligence to Barca, walked to Venas. There I took the post here, but Hapgood and Berenson walked. I went to another hotel from the one arranged, and failed to catch them on the way, so they had a tiresome hunt. Bernhard was very cross. </p>
		<p>Saw the Church, etc.</p>
