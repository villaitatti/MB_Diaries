		<p>x Friday, September 30, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>Spent the morning in San Marco and the Doge’s Palace. </p>
		<p>I was tired in the afternoon and stayed in but Bernhard went to the Gallery. </p>
		<p>Read Charles V. </p>
		<p>Bernhard is reading Balbo’s History of Italy,</p>
		<p> and finds it good, though absurdly old-fashioned. </p>
		<p>> Saturday, October 1, 1892, Venice</p>
		<p>San Marco, San Giorgio in Bragora, the Scuola di San Giorgio Schiavoni, San Francesco della Vigna, San Giovanni e Paolo, and Santa Maria Formosa in the morning. </p>
		<p>San Giorgio Maggiore and San Giuseppe in Castello in the afternoon, and a gondola ride. </p>
		<p>Met the Americans being hurried about by a courier. </p>
