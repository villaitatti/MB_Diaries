		<p>Pitti in the morning and finished re-writing our Paris Bordone. </p>
		<p>B. went to Costa’s and I took mother and Lady Albinia to the Uffizi, and then went to see Gertrude. </p>
		<p>Loeser came to dinner with us and we talked and looked at Lionardo drawings and talked — all of us rather bored, I fear. </p>
		<p>* Thursday, January 14, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Pitti in the morning. </p>
		<p>Miss Farnell and Mr. Mitchell called in afternoon. </p>
		<p>B. called on Costa. </p>
		<p>In the evening we re-wrote our Paris Bordone, which I sent to the Michael Fields. </p>
		<p>Friday, January 15, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Pitti in the morning, still on the Venetians. Showed Miss Farnell, etc., some pictures which made B. cross. </p>
		<p>B. called on Costa. </p>
		<p>It was dreadfully raining, so I stayed at home and read Burckhardt. </p>
		<p>In [0189] the evening we rewrote our Bonifazio.</p>
		<p>Saturday, January 16, 1892. Florence</p>
		<p>Finished the Venetians in the Pitti. </p>
		<p>B. went to see Costa and I to see Gertrude. </p>
		<p>He did not come to dinner, and I read Vol. I of Yriarte’s César Borgia.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>B. invented the word “Pruritanic.” He went to hear Le Barbre de Seville with Loeser. </p>
		<p>Sunday, January 17, 1892, Florence </p>
		<p>Bargello in the morning. </p>
		<p>Tea with Loeser at 24 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Bernhard’s room, after the two had been to call on the Ways, a proceeding which they compared to a Turkish Bath. Bernhard said that Mrs. Way sighed delightfully. Loeser was rather nice. </p>
		<p>In the evening I read Layard and Crowe and Cavalcaselle on Lorenzo Monaco, and Prescott’s description of Charles VIII in Italy.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Missed Bernhard. </p>
