		<p>I was ill, but went for a while to the Academy. </p>
		<p>Came home and read Venetian Studies. </p>
		<p>Rested in the afternoon and wrote. B. called on Mlle Jackowska. </p>
		<p>* Friday, October 23, 1891, Venice </p>
		<p>Went to Ducal Palace in morning, and to the Scuola di S. Rocco in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>Then I went to the Frari while B. went with Mlle Jackowska to see the paintings of a certain Swiss Baron. He was well bored.</p>
		<p>I walked back with Costa along the Giudecca and discussed Sebastiano del Piombo and the great books B. is to write. </p>
		<p>Wrote and looked at photos in the evening. </p>

		<p>Finished our notes on the Ducal Palace, and then went to S. Giuliano and then met Costa at S. Giovanni Crisostomo. </p>
		<p>Then B. went to S. Simeone to see if the ‘Trinity’ there was by Catena or Benedetto Diana. [140] He decided it was Catena, under Botti’s repaint! </p>
		<p>He met Costa and me at S. Cassiano.</p>
		<p>In the afternoon we all went to the Frari. </p>
