		<p>Went to gallery in morning and looked over the drawings. The only ones of note were the Fra Bartolommeos (especially a Head of a Woman); Mantegna, Madonna with an angel on each side; Sodoma, Virtues driving out Vices (analogous to Mantegna’s picture in the Louvre); some small Cupid pictures by Penni; a Mantegna, and a much destroyed Pollaijuolo.</p>
		<p>Afterwards we studied the Italian pictures. B. disagrees with Morelli on several points: 1. That the so-called “Lionardo” is not Flemish but Italian, possibly an early Verocchio. 2. That the so-called Luini is not a Solario. 3. That the Paris Bordone Portrait is not much repainted. 4. [0110] That the Moretto is a Moretto, and not a Moroni.</p>
		<p>Looked at the Dürer engravings.</p>
		<p>After quarrelled slightly and then walked in the Park. </p>
		<p>Saturday, September 5, 1891, Hotel Roth, Munich </p>
		<p>We took the 7 o’clock train to Augsburg. I read Faust all the way. </p>
		<p>Wandered about the town and saw the Cathedral. The stained glass windows of the 11th century mentioned by Baedeker exist only in his imagination. Cathedral filled with altar-pictures by German masters, best seemed to be by Burckmeyer.</p>
		<p>At 9 went to the gallery and looked at the Italian pictures there. The most beautiful was a Tintoretto. </p>
