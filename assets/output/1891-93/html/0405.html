		<p>Mr. Burke arrived at 6. We went with him to the Louvre and to Durand-Ruel’s. There we saw pictures that made up for the poor Salon! Pissaro [sic] had made real advances, Degas is doing delightful landscapes, and we saw our first Forain</p>
		<p> picture, which Bernhard christened “l’Art et l’Artiste”. Burke bought it for 1800 francs. </p>
		<p>Then we went to the Champ de Mars and afterwards to Maude’s and had tea with Helen Hopekirk and some others.</p>
		<p>Read Underneath the Bough</p>
		<p> in the evening and arranged their “revised and decreased” edition.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, June 7, 1893, Paris</p>
		<p>Champ de Mars and Durand-Ruel’s. </p>
		<p>Enjoyed Islach’s wooden sculpture, La Reclame. It ought to stand in the lobby of the House of Commons!</p>
		<p>Michael made a more than usual goose of herself discussing Rossetti in the evening. </p>
		<p>Thursday, June 8, 1893, Paris</p>
		<p>Read our Venetian article in the morning. </p>
		<p>Went to Durand-Ruel’s private collection in the afternoon, and there, while Bernhard looked at a picture by Culpp</p>
		<p> at their business house, which his rich American</p>
		<p> wants to buy, I bought toys for the children.</p>
		<p>We dined with Burke and Maude at the Alcazar,</p>
		<p> and spent the evening at Helen Hopekirk’s, who played divinely for us. Her husband told me that, taken all the year round, she only practises 3/4 of an hour a day. That is what it is to have brains and a good method. </p>
