		<p>A most “pendulumistic” letter from Hapgood, who says I mustn’t criticize James for talking rot about art, because he has done good work in physiological psychology, and that one thing is the same as another, and Harvard as good as Florence, and Hegel as good as Science, etc., etc., quite in the spirit of those first depressing talks we had in Paris, which he ceased from when he opened his eyes a little. O Americans! </p>
		<p>We worked on our Lotto, and then went to see Perugino’s Last Supper.</p>
		<p>After lunch we did some more work and then walked over the hills after seeing the Calzi Perugino. </p>
		<p>At lunch we met Jenkins who has been suffering horribly for a month with neuralgia. His description of his tortures made your flesh creep. He declares that a spirit, in the shape of a monk, comes to him and tells him the winning numbers in the National Lottery. So I asked him to make two hundred pounds for me, and he promised to do so. But my conscience need not begin to prick me for ill-gotten gains! </p>
