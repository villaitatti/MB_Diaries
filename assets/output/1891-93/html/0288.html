		<p>I felt much worse and did not go out. Read Adolfe.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Went to Dr Laudonzy at 4. He said I had inflammation of the womb and ovaries, besides my stomach. He prescribed a very strict diet and absolute rest. I had a great deal of pain. </p>
		<p>Bernhard dined with Bôcher.</p>
		<p>* Wednesday, August 24, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>A dreadful day. I could not read, but bored myself all day and tormented both of us. I felt very unhappy.</p>
		<p>Thursday, August 25, 1892, Paris</p>
		<p>Still on my back. Burke came in while we were at breakfast. Bernhard took him to Durand-Ruel’s to see the pictures he wants to buy.</p>
		<p>After lunch they went to the Hotel de Ville. They liked the Lerolles.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I read La Bête Humaine.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I have read a great many of Zola’s novels. Let me see how many: L’Oeuvre,</p>
		<p> La Curée, Germinal, Nana, La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret, La Rêve, Pot-Bouille, La Joie de Vivre, Au Bonheur des Dames, Les Contes à Ninon.</p>
		<p> I do not remember any others. </p>
		<p>Bernhard is reading Germinie Lacerteux,</p>
		<p> and we are reading aloud, for the second time, Creighton’s History of the Papacy.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Burke came to tea. </p>
