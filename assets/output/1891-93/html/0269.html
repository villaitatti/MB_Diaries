		<p>Then 〈from Cremona〉 we came to Brescia. </p>
		<p>I finished Symonds’ Catholic Reaction, and began Michelet’s Renaissance. B. is going the other way. </p>
		<p>Monday, May 9, 1892, Albergo Concordia, Bergamo</p>

		<p>> Tuesday, May 10, 1892, Bergamo </p>
		<p>We tried to go to Alsano in the morning, but were deceived as to the train, so, after wasting an hour (reading, however) and much temper, we came back and worked on our book. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon we did get there, but it was too wet and dark to see the Lotto. Bernhard wasted much vital energy upon a vain quarrel with the Railway Company. </p>
		<p>In the evening we wrote. </p>
		<p>All this was Wednesday. ☜ </p>
