		<p>Drove to Cingoli, missing our way and passing through Arpignano and Arulane. A fearfully steep climb to Cingoli, which is on one of the highest spurs of the Appenines. From the town wall we saw about a fourth of the whole Adriatic coast, a superb panorama. It makes it so enchanting too, to have each hill crowned with an old fortified town, and to be sure that each one holds beautiful palaces, interesting historical relics of all kinds, and perhaps marvellous pictures. </p>
		<p>Cingoli, a deserted, inaccessible place, has a magnificent Palace, Egidio of Viterbo (1531) on the Piazza, and in the Church a Lotto!! We spent an hour and a half in rapture before it. It was hard to come away. </p>
		<p>The little Albergo there (Via Cavour) seemed nice. We had a good lunch of eggs and sausages and veal and fruit and a glass of Marsala and coffee for 85 centimes each!!</p>
		<p>Thursday, October 27, 1892, Macerata</p>
		<p>A cloudy day, but we drove to San Severino and saw the Pintoricchio, the Bern〈ardino di〉 Mariotto and the Nic〈ola〉 da Foligno. </p>
		<p>On the way back we took in Tolentino, and found a magnificent Tomb of S. Niccolo in the Church, also fine cloisters. </p>
		<p>The “Triumphal Arch” guide books are so loud in praise of, does not exist, nor has ever existed! It is the portal of the church, put up by Nic〈ola〉 Piccinino. Now having come to such an out-of-the-way spot to verify the original mis-translation from XV century Latin, the legend of the Triumphal [0317] Arch has been handed finally down. </p>
		<p>On the road coming back we passed a perfectly preserved Castle with turrets and battlements and towers complete, a most picturesque building. Not mentioned in the guides! </p>
		<p>I was very ill in the night, in horrible pain.</p>
		<p>* Friday, October 28, 1892, Aquila d’Oro, Matelica  (Giuseppe Amici, albergatore)</p>
		<p>“Did” Macerata with the assistance of the Canonico Bettucci whom we met in his Church of San Giovanni. He took us to a little Church, S. Maria della Misericordia, where there is a mysterious alter-piece ascribed indiscriminately to Crivelli and to Perugino! It was almost hidden by a wooden case, but we climbed up and saw what we could, and that little looked like Melozzo. This disconcerted him, as he has prepared a history of the Church which is all ready to be printed, except for the author of the picture. He came to see us off at the Station and presented us with a book he wrote to refute somebody who dared to deny that Tasso ever submitted his Gerusalemme Liberata to the Macerata Academy. </p>
		<p>We arrived here in a perfect evening, with bright moonlight.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately we both have colds. </p>
