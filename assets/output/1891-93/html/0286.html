		<p>I was ill with inflammation of the bowels and worry combined. In fact, when I signed the Deed I was ill, too ill not to be a coward. </p>
		<p>Afterwards I spent a long time in bed at Haslemere, suffering a great deal of pain. Ray was very sweet. </p>
		<p>Bernhard stayed with his sister and Miss Jordan in London, and then with the Burkes here. Then, on Mr. Burke’s invitation, I came here. What a pleasure it has been to see Bernhard. He is more dear to me that ever. </p>
		<p>His sister is here also, and she hates me, as Alys and Logan hate Berenson. </p>

		<p>* Wednesday, August 17 [16], 1892, Hotel du Grand Cerf, Nantes</p>
		<p>I was surprisingly well, and we went about to see the sights, the Cathedral and St. Ouen, the back of which outside we particularly enjoyed, 〈and〉 the Musée, where we found a Longhi [0287] and 3 pradelle by Gerino da Pistoia and a picture by Balducci (called Botticelli), and the Puvis decorative paintings which are not to be compared with those at Amiens. </p>
		<p>Then we came here. Read Liaisons Dangereuses.</p>

		<p>Went to the Louvre and began our notes. </p>
		<p>I was not very well, and I felt very cross at meeting Bôcher unexpectedly. Bernhard lunched with him. I decided not to bear malice against him for his garrulity, so I wrote him a peace-making note.</p>
