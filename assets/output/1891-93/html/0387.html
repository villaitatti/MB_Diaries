		<p>Bernhard started for Rome at 6.35 in the morning. </p>
		<p>I “magazined” his Carl Frey in the morning. </p>
		<p>After lunch I took Miss Lohse to the Pitti and gave her tea here. </p>
		<p>Then finished my “magazining”, had dinner, and worked on the Catalogue.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, April 18, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Unwell. </p>
		<p>Worked all day, on catalogue, story “Crabbed Age”, and other things. </p>
		<p>Bernhard still in Rome.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, April 19, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>Still at work. </p>
		<p>Bernhard returned at 9, and had great stories to tell of his millionaire Americans. Mr. Davis was going to pay £12,000 (!) for four utterly worthless pictures, which Bernhard saved him from. They were very amusing, and very American. </p>
		<p>Thursday, April 20, 1893, Florence</p>
		<p>We worked all day till 5, going over the Catalogue, sorting photographs, etc., etc. </p>
		<p>Then Bernhard went to call on “Vernon Lee” [0388] and I met “the Mikes” at their trains. </p>
		<p>He went to see his American friends</p>
		<p> in the evening, as they have come up to Florence, and the Mikes came here. </p>
		<p>He came in later, and spoke against rhyme in English poetry, and of how blank verse so dominates our literary expression that prose is its mere bastard. </p>
		<p>I made two analogies, quite in the spirit of “the Master”. </p>
		<p>We were speaking of the mistake of looking for other things in painting in place of the primary delight of the eye. Bernhard said that all art was only valuable as human expression. </p>
		<p>“Yes”, I said, “but in painting it expresses itself to the eye, and not to the other senses. Everybody would think it absurd to kick a picture.” </p>
		<p>Then, when he was reporting to me Mr. Feilding’s</p>
		<p> criticisms of the Signorelli of the Uffizi, that such a scale of colour was never seen in nature, I said “You ought to have reminded him that he, who is a musician, produces harmonics of sound that are never heard in nature.” I repeat these to remind myself on dull days, that I can be witty! </p>
