		<p>“My dear child, it is best for us all, as a family to be perfectly frank with one another. I want to tell thee how deeply, how tenderly thy mother and I sympathize with thee in this crisis of thy life. …</p>
		<p>“Thank thee” …</p>
		<p>“She has told me of thy plan of spending next winter in Florence with Mrs. Burton, and I wish to assure thee that I will make every sacrifice to keep thee from being troubled about money, or dependent in any way.”</p>
		<p>“That is very kind, father.”</p>
		<p>“But, my dear child, I want to remind thee that the whole happiness of [0059] thy family depends upon thee now. Thee cannot understand how thy mother and I feel, until thy own child lives to be as old as thee. We are of course greatly crushed, but I do not speak of that. I want thee to understand that we are on thy side, my dear child, and that we will stand by thee.” </p>
		<p>“Thank thee.”</p>
		<p>“As far as possible. In our old age, when we were looking forward, after a life of great, very great, sacrifices for our children, when we had made all our arrangements to be so pleasantly together, it will be very hard to lose thee. I do not speak of myself, but thy mother, my dear, is bound up in this, and, in her [0060] prominent position as a religious leader, it will bring her to the grave if any breath of scandal should touch thee. I tell thee frankly, it would, I think, kill me. … However, let us not speak of that. My life has been very hard in some ways, of which my children know nothing. I have never mentioned it, but it has cost me constantly recurring pecuniary embarrassment to place you in the position of independence which I have done, owing to some unexpected losses.”</p>
		<p>“Thee has been most kind, father.”</p>
		<p>“Therefore, my dear, I want thee to see, as I am sure thee must see, [0061] that families must stand together. Our position in England is not at all established. Thy brother and sister are making many nice friends, but if any scandal arose in the family, it would at once ruin their position. Our whole happiness as a family depends upon thee. Then there are thy children, thy two little daughters. For their sakes, thee should make every sacrifice, to avoid clouding and compromising their futures.”</p>
		<p>“I do not wish to injure them.”</p>
		<p>“No, my dear, I am sure thee does not. Then there is thy husband, whose life thee is wrecking. He is a true man, and I am sure there are not ten men in England who would behave as well as he [0062] has done under the present state of things.”</p>
		<p>“That is quite likely.”</p>
		<p>“Surely thee owes much to him. Thee has responsibilities, duties, towards his life. Thee may wreck it and ruin his happiness and his career forever, merely for a foolish or a passing impulse. I implore thee, my child, to realize that none of us stand alone, that we all have to make sacrifices, very great sacrifices, to each other. My life has been full of sacrifices for my children, and you would not be where you are now, if I had thought merely of my own pleasure. … I want [0063] thee to realize too, my dear, that thy name is very well known through England, on account of the important political work with which thee has been associated. Thee knows that London is the centre of the world.” … </p>
		<p>“A purely English prejudice.”</p>
		<p>“the centre of the world, and everything that happens here or to people who are well known in London, is known all over the world. Thee knows what vipers’ tongues English people have, how quick they are to spread scandals. I assure thee, thee could not live in Florence, a place full of idle English people, seeing Mr. Berenson constantly and going to the galleries with him, without very grave scandal, which would [0064] break up thy family and crush thy mother and me to the grave. … Furthermore, I want to remind thee with what impulsiveness thee took the decisive step of marriage, in spite of all we could do. I knew at the time that it would result unhappily, curiously enough, I gave thee just six years, just this time, but thee would not heed our advice.”</p>
		<p>“No, I would not.” </p>
		<p>“Now, my daughter, we are all just as sure of thy misery in this new infatu--, this new friendship into which thee has impulsively rushed. I do not wish to say anything about Mr. Berenson, [0065] whom in many ways I like, but I want thee to remember that he has no antecedents, nothing to guarantee his considerate behaviour, nothing to show us that he would guard thee from the breath of scandal, nothing to reassure thee as to his … steadfastness. It is not as if we know his family and antecedents, not as if he were tied by them to behave as we should wish.</p>
		<p>I want thee to realize too, my dear child, that most marriages are uncongenial. But everyone sees that it is much better to arrange some modus vivendi, to keep the family together, to avoid the scandal to the growing children, than to [0066] separate in a hasty impulse. The law of life is mutual sacrifice, and no one is ever happy by bringing misery upon others. As an Evangelist, I have had people tell me things they do not tell to others, and I know that few married lives are even as happy as thy own. This happens even among good earnest prayerful Christians, who mean right with all their hearts. But society is so formed that the marriage tie is irrevocable, and we must sacrifice our inclinations. Think of thy friend Edmund Gurney.</p>
		<p> He was terribly unhappy all his life, although his was a good, sweet woman.”</p>
