		<p>Reached here 11.15 and saw Sant’Anastasia before lunch. </p>
		<p>My home letters were as usual very distressing, father threatening not to leave me any of his money.</p>
		<p>After lunch we went to the Gallery. Again the pictures looked crude and provincial, little enjoyable after Venice. But the town is divine! </p>
		<p>I read Spaventi’s Pisanello</p>
		<p> in the evening, and Bernhard Ranke. </p>
		<p>Sunday, October 22, 1893, Verona</p>
		<p>I was still unwell, but struggled out to the Duomo, S. Eufemia and Sant’Anastasia. </p>
		<p>Remained in and rested and wrote in the afternoon while Bernhard went to S. Bernardino, S. Zeno, and S. Fermo. When he came in he defined genius as a “vortex of thought and feeling.” </p>
		<p>Wrote and read. </p>
		<p>Monday, October 23, 1893, Verona</p>
		<p>I was ill, and when I struggled out to S. Naz〈areno〉 e Celso I found it was too much for me, and I had to come back. </p>
		<p>Bernhard went to S. Maria in Organo and the Gallery. </p>
		<p>I read Ranke and an awful Italian book on the Veronese artists by Zannandreis,</p>
		<p> which Bernhard spent the evening cursing. </p>
		<p>At dinner we talked with some adherents of Murray’s Guide.</p>
		<p> One of them said, “Well, I like him because I know he is an Englishman, and I don’t like foreigners.”</p>
