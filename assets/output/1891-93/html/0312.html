		<p>We went to the Ducal Palace at Urbino again, and to the Duomo and S. Francesco, St. Spirito and Raphael’s House, and the Casa Albani, where we found, in the midst of rooms of rubbish a genuine and most interesting Savoldo.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Bernhard went to S. Giovanni, too, to see some frescoes dating from 1416. </p>
		<p>It rained hard after lunch, but cleared up, and we started back at 2.30 in sunshine, but were overtaken by rain again. </p>
		<p>Pretty tired and lazy in the evening. </p>
		<p>Thursday, October 20, 1892, Albergo Roma, Ancona </p>
		<p>Had a splendid light on the Bellini in Pesaro, and discovered two Bellinis in the Pinacoteca —— !!</p>
		<p>At 12.30 went to Fano where we had lunch. In the piazza, looking for the entrance to the Teatro where there were said to be pictures, we asked the way of a well-dressed man. He took us to a youth and commanded him to show us “nostra camera nel Municipio”, from which we inferred that he was no less a personage than Il Sindaco himself. Our guide confirmed this and told us he was the Duca di Montevecchio. We found nothing [0313] either in the Theatre or Municipio, but in the Churches we saw two Giovanni Santis and two Peruginos, one with charming predelle. </p>
		<p>We reached Ancona at 7.</p>
		<p>Friday, October 21, 1892, Ancona</p>
		<p>The heavens were opened, but we swam up to S. Domenico and had an hour and a half over the glorious Titian there. Then we had an hour in the Pinacoteca. </p>
		<p>After lunch I finished my article for The Women’s Herald. </p>
		<p>Bernhard went to the Duomo. I went later, when I had finished my writing, thinking I might join him there, but we missed. Hence a dreadful quarrel, which made us both unhappy. </p>
		<p>Saturday, October 22, 1892, Ancona</p>
		<p>Spent the day at Jesi, where we saw a great many wonderful Lottos. </p>
		<p>Sunday, October 23, 1892, Ancona</p>
		<p>Loreto 9-12.30. </p>
		<p>Saw the Melozzos, Signorellis and Lottos. </p>
		<p>Drove to Recanati. We found the librarian (a priest) away for the day, and so we could not see the Lottos! Great rage and useless indignation. [0314]</p>
		<p> Monday, October 24, 1892, ** Albergo Milano, Macerata  diretto da Cesare Fratini</p>
		<p>Drove again to Recanati. On the way we bought some grapes of several intelligent contadine. They asked where we came from. “Inghilterra”. They looked blank “Non avete sentito mai dell’Inghilterra?” “No, Signore, mai, mai!” </p>
		<p>We succeeded in seeing the Lottos this time and found them very interesting. </p>
		<p>We walked out to look at a wonderful view of snow mountains. A young woman with a baby followed us. We told her we were from America and asked her if she had ever heard of America. “Chi lo sa!” was her answer.</p>
		<p>We drove on here, reaching here about 6. The cooking is simply marvellous here! … </p>
		<p>Flea powder, applied lavishly, banishes fleas, but it is horribly dirty. Still I prefer dirt to fleas! </p>
		<p>Tuesday, October 25, 1892, Macerata </p>
		<p>Drove to Monte San Giusto and saw a Crucifixion by Lotto which is perhaps his masterpiece. </p>
		<p>They had no coffee in the town! As it was a festa, the whole population followed us everywhere and cheered us when we drove off. I suppose they had never seen a female “forestiere” before. On our way back we took in Pansula, where we discovered a Crivelli! </p>
		<p>We both seem rather cross these days, and I am unhappy except when I am at work. Each little thing I see keeps reminding me of [0315] Ray, and it seems as if I could not give her up. I know so clearly in my mind all that is to be said, and I realize how clinging to her will make me unhappy and worse still Bernhard, and won’t do her much (if any) good. Yes, I see it all as clearly as a mathematical problem, I fear. Yet I cannot — ! This struggle going on from day to day is very painful. Yet after I cut it, I know it will be far more painful. Bernhard’s patience is giving out, too, I can see so well. He finds almost everything I do amiss, and shows at every moment his contempt for the feeling I have for Ray which he thinks is mere brute instinct, simply killing my personality. He said if I gave her up he would be prepared for my being unhappy a long time, but eventually getting over it. Alas! I am sure he would not have the patience to bear with me during that time. It is very natural he should feel so. He has no family ties, life is full of all sorts of marvellous possibilities for him, and a great deal is spoiled because of my mistake, because of my child, whom he thinks a rather detestable specimen of humanity in herself.</p>
		<p>Thus are we entered upon that stormy era which in matrimony usually precedes shipwreck, where one wishes and natural inclinations pull different ways, and where we begin to “get on each other’s nerves”. </p>
		<p>Alas, I do love him so!</p>
