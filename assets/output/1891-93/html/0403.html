		<p>Started in the train at 6.10 for Celana, and after a delightful walk through country more exhilarating and dewy than Switzerland itself, found our Lotto. We spent three hours enjoying it. </p>
		<p>Wrote and Bernhard called on Signor Piccinelli while I met the Mikes in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>Sunday, May 28, 1893, Bergamo</p>
		<p>Took the Mikes to the Gallery in the morning and to the Piccinelliâ€™s in the afternoon. Wrote.</p>
		<p>Monday, May 29, 1893, Bergamo</p>
		<p>Lotto intarsias. Churches. </p>
		<p>Went with Signor Piccinelli to see the Roncagli picture, where I discovered a Bartolomeo Veneto!</p>
		<p> And to the Moroni collection. </p>
		<p>The Bergamo bells are excruciating. We all feel as if the grey matter of our brains was being beaten to a froth like white of egg.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, May 30, 1893, Bella Venezia, Milan</p>
		<p>The Church Bells drove us away from Bergamo this evening as if we had been the veritable devils which they were delighted to drive away!</p>
		<p>In the morning Bernhard and I went to Grumello</p>
		<p> and drove along vine-scented lanes to three little towns near. We enjoyed every moment. We saw, besides the ruined Lotto we came in quest of, a splendid Romanino fresco. </p>
		<p>We saw the Intarsias before starting. </p>
		<p>Bernhard said one of his best things, that old people take new ideas like medicine, young people take them like food. </p>
