		<p>We saw the Borgia appartments [sic], but did not care much for the Pintoricchios. [sic] Few of them were executed by him, evidently. </p>
		<p>Then, while Bernhard went to call on a Monsignore, who offered to sell him his private collection, which would make him, if he presented it to America, ‘more famous than Washington’. </p>
		<p>Michael Field and I went to the Stanze and the Vatican Gallery. The Raphaels gave us little but pain and disgust. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon, Bernhard went with Miss Sellers and a party of Germans to the Villa Albani, and we went to S. Paolo, and to the graves of Keats and Shelley. </p>
		<p>We discussed Raphael in the evening. </p>
		<p>Tuesday, May 9, 1893, Rome</p>
		<p>Field was ill with stomach-ache, and Michael nursed her all day. </p>
		<p>We met Miss Sellers and her friend and a German Professor (who is absurdly in love with Miss Sellers) at the Doria. The Velasquez is simply overwhelming. It knocks all the moderns flat. </p>
		<p>Then Prof. Klein took us to see some wonderful decoration from Augustus’ Altar to Peace, all the Mediaeval and Renaissance motives. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon Bernhard called on the Vedders</p>
		<p> and Mond,</p>
		<p> and Michael and I took a walk and bought photos. </p>
