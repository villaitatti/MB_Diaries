		<p>Bernhard’s long desire is accomplished: we have seen the Church at Todi. To our surprise, Todi itself turns out to be a more important town, with a fine gothic cathedral, Renaissance palaces, a well-preserved side of a Roman Basilica, etc. </p>
		<p>The hotel is impossible, but the Restaurant (del Teatro) is good, and they found us sleeping places in a palace close by S. Fortunato. </p>
		<p>We drove here, starting on 8 and reaching here at 1.30. We “did” Diruta on the way, finding a Fiorenzo and an Eusebio. We spent all the afternoon in and around the glorious Church.</p>

		<p>It was one of the Great Experiences of our lives. Drive 25 francs.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, November 9, 1892, Belle Arti, Perugia </p>
		<p>We saw Todi in the morning, all too hurriedly, and started at 12. </p>
		<p>Stopped at S. M. di Consolazione again of course, and also saw another fine church, from 1591 outside another gate. </p>
		<p>Reached here about 5.30 and dined at the Progresso, which seems rather nicer than this place. Wrote letters, but were rather tired and sleepy. </p>
