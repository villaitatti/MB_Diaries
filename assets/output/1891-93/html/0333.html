		<p>I read The Pretenders</p>
		<p> and saw a good deal in it. </p>
		<p>Met Costa and saw the Ghiberti, Donatellos, and Lucca della Robbias of the Duomo and then went to the Riccardi Palace to see the Benozzos. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon and evening, lunched over my article on Potapen[c]ko, while Bernhard enjoy〈ed〉 himself reading magazines.</p>
		<p>x Friday, December 2, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Wrote, and Bernhard lunched with me. The ideas of the darned article are “stupendo”, but they aren’t said clearly or nicely.</p>
		<p>We went to the Bargello and enjoyed ourselves. </p>
		<p>Bernhard walked in the Cascine, and Costa came to call, and again was very nice.</p>
		<p>Type-wrote the article, such as it is. </p>
		<p>Bernhard gave birth to several ideas, such as the Law of Popularity for books, and the law of their living. The former is a book that describes the contemporary phase of the struggle for existence, the latter book that adds to the world’s capital. Of course they may go together.</p>
