		<p>We looked at Filippino and Ghirlandaio in the Pitti and Uffizi in the morning. Costa joined in. He seemed dreadfully depressed. </p>
		<p>In the afternoon I went down to write quietly with B., as the four children and smoky fires made it quite uninhabitable here. But Loeser came in and had tea and interrupted us. </p>
		<p>We worked further on the Correggio in the evening, and I began to write childrenâ€™s stories. If they are successful, I ought to be able to support myself by them. </p>
		<p>* Thursday, February 18, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Fra Bartolommeo, Granacci, Ridolfo Ghirlandaio in the morning, also Raffaelo Botticini. </p>
		<p>We lunched with Loeser, who gave us a capital lunch. </p>
		<p>Musgrave came in the afternoon and while B. read Herrick,</p>
		<p> he dictated to me the first Canti of his translation of Dante, which I did for him on the type-writer. </p>
		<p>We looked at photographs, and B. almost decided that the so-called Signorelli fresco in the Sistine Chapel is by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. </p>
		<p>Finished our Correggio and sent it off to Cram.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I wrote more of my story. </p>
