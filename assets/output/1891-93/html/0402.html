		<p>Went to Jesi. </p>
		<p>Returned to Ancona at 5 and Bernhard and I walked up to the Cathedral and saw a wonderful sunset. It suddenly came out under a heavy line of clouds and lighted up the town like a strange calcium light. Our rooms had fine views of the harbour, and were clean. </p>
		<p>Thursday, May 25, 1893, Albergo del Sole, Bergamo</p>
		<p>From Ancona here, 5.30 - 5.30 with an hour’s stop at Milan. </p>
		<p>“Michael Field” stayed behind to see Ancona and Rimini.</p>
		<p>Friday, May 26, 1893, Bergamo </p>
		<p>Started for Sedrina at 8. Our horse jumped over a bridge and had a horrible fall into the stream below. Fortunately, he was not killed, nor we either!</p>
		<p>Another carriage was found and went to Sedrina and saw a Lotto, then to Ponte Ranica</p>
		<p> for the same.</p>
		<p>After lunch we revised the Lotto chronology, and went to S. Bernardino, Santo Spirito and the photographers!</p>
		<p>Michael Field telegraphed from Forlì that they would not come till tomorrow. So much the better. </p>
