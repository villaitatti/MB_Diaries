		<p>… Size beyond a certain point seems of as little importance in giving us a perfect effect of spaciousness as length is necessary to the beauty of a symphony … </p>
		<p>If you seize the meaning of these few pages, you will see at a glance why it was that the great problem of the Renaissance was the cruciform dome church. It had to be domed, because, as I have tried to show, the perfection of space is attainable only the meeting of four arms under a dome. The arms are the arches I have been speaking of all the time. It had to be cruciform, that is to say, the arms had to be of equal [2.3] length, so that from whatever arm you entered you at once got the complete effect of the interior. No arm could be longer; in other words, no arch deeper.</p>
		<p>… I have copied the rest of this elsewhere so I will not go on. I hope it has in it the germ of a very fruitful idea of Bernhard’s upon Renaissance architecture.</p>
