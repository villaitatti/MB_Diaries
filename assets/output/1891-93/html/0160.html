		<p>Cold impossible, but it had to be endured. </p>
		<p>Costa and B. studied Titian at the Gallery.</p>
		<p>Janet came to tea and stayed for a little talk, in which Berenson compared the Jesuits’ way of roc〈o〉cofying the different architectures, so that they all came out alike, to their way of treating human characters. Janet appeared horrified at the idea of frankly enjoying people like pictures. </p>
		<p>Tuesday, November 10, 1891, Vienna </p>
		<p>We went to the Lichtenstein. I enjoyed most the Franz Hals, and the Verocchio and also the Savoldo. </p>
		<p>But it was very cold and I felt ill. I started to go home alone, but lost my way and had to come back, and was, I am sorry to say, horribly cross. It made me unhappy. </p>
		<p>Tea with Janet. </p>
		<p>Wickhoff called. </p>
		<p>Read Goncourt’s Journal. </p>
