		<p>Bernhard in London, I at Friday’s Hill. </p>
		<p>x Monday, July 18, 1892</p>
		<p>I met B.F.C.C. at 44 Grosvenor Road. He said he had made the children Wards of Chancery. He said he had proofs of my adultery with Bernhard. I said that it was impossible, although I knew he might easily have what would suffice before a British Jury. He could not show me the proofs, but he said he had laid them before Sir Charles Russell.</p>
		<p>I went away to think it over. I saw Frank in the evening, and told him that I found I had not the courage, considering my parents and the children and my own poverty — dependent as I am at present upon father — to insist upon a divorce. It is [corrected from ‘was’] his interest, too, to keep it quiet, so we decided to make a deed of Separation. </p>
		<p>I think it very likely that some day I will insist upon his producing all those proofs he speaks of, and, if they are really sufficient to give me a divorce, getting it.</p>
		<p>Tuesday, July 19, 1892 </p>
		<p>He [corrected from ‘we’] made our deed of Separation and took it to read to mother and father and Logan, who had come up for the purpose. Poor mother was in genuine anguish, tempered by the feeling [0285] that, since it was so, it was God’s Will. Father had a pompously solemn face, but secretly he enjoyed playing the part of the Parent in a Tragedy. It was a real interest. But I am sure he thinks he is miserable. Logan realized that it wasn’t his business, after all, and thanked his stars he wasn’t married. Afterwards he said it was ridiculous not to make marriages “on approval”. I said Frank was acting “nobly” from the point of view of old-fashioned literature, but abominably from the real point of view, I mean the contemporary point of view. He had absolutely no right to make my children Wards of Chancery without consulting me. It makes me indignant to think of it. And that anything I might choose to do, or he might think I had deliberately chosen to do, could justify him, I cannot see. However, it may really be all right for them, because I realize that a young person like myself, in the throes of emancipation, is not a good education for very little children. Something settled is, I believe, better for them. At any rate, I am never to be denied access to them. But I am really too ill to think.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, I came down to Friday’s Hill. The “Mikes” spent the night. They were simple angels to me. </p>
