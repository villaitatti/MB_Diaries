		<p>Saw the Andrea del Sarto frescoes at the Annunziata, the Scalzo, San Salvi and the Academy. </p>
		<p>I paid a short call on Gertrude. </p>
		<p>After my Italian lesson I went to B.’s where I had tea and read Huysmans’ wonderful little story called “Un Dilemme”. </p>
		<p>We walked and in the evening I read my children’s story to B. I have decided to call it Linden Stories or Summers at Linden. He was very enthusiastic, to my great delight. How I hope it may turn out to be worth while. I would like to support myself. </p>
		<p>* Friday, February 26, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>I went to the tomb of the Medici in the morning. </p>
		<p>Gertrude gave me her criticisms on our Correggio article, which she seemed to think very important, but I did not find them worth much. </p>
		<p>After my lesson we walked nearly to the Villa Careggi. </p>
		<p>Then came home and had tea. </p>
		<p>B. read Creighton’s History of the Papacy</p>
		<p> and I finished the first part of my Linden Stories. B. thought it good. </p>
		<p>After he went, I read some of Creighton too. </p>
		<p>* [0220] Saturday, February 27, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Looked at Pontormo and Bronzino in the Pitti and Uffizi. </p>
		<p>Coming home I met Edith Kendall who asked me to dine. </p>
		<p>I took tea with B. and then went on. On the whole, I was bored. I was never very much Edith’s friend, and now I feel as if we had very little in common. She is travelling with an awful brother. She looks very fat and middle-aged, with yellow wrinkles about her eyes. I wonder if I look as old and commonplace to her?! No doubt. Well, I’m not, I know. </p>
		<p>I went back to B.’s at 9 and found he had had a call from Musgrave. </p>
		<p>Read Maupassant’s Clair de lune.</p>
		<p> There is no doubt that Huysmans’ simple story “Un Dilemme” makes Maupassant’s seems very “prepared”, almost melodramatic. </p>
		<p>Sunday, February 28, 1892, Florence</p>
		<p>Galleries closed. </p>
		<p>Went to see Rossi at San Lorenzo. </p>
		<p>Met Costa on our way back and he came to fix my type-writer, which had gone wrong. He stayed all the morning. It wasted some time, but on the whole we were glad to see that he was in no way angry. </p>
		<p>In [0221] the afternoon we walked and semi-quarrelled about walking (which I hate), but made up. </p>
		<p>Then I took a nap while B. read Creighton’s History of the Papacy, and then I type-wrote half of my story. </p>
		<p>Alas! that time is so short. I had a hundred other things I wanted to do in the day, but I went to bed at 11 very tired. </p>
		<p>Monday, February 29, 1891, Florence </p>
		<p>(Where will we be on the next 29th of February? Together, at any rate.)</p>
		<p>Met at S. Lorenzo and looked at Rosso and Bronzino and Sogliani, and the Donatello altars. The Library was closed.</p>
		<p>Costa came late, but we met him on our way out and we went to the Gallery connected with Santa Maria Nuova. The Hugo van du Gois impressed me very much. </p>
		<p>Then we went to the Academy to look for a Lorenzo Monaco mentioned by Crowe and Cavalcaselle - Milanese. </p>
		<p>Then I came home and had my lesson and went to see Gertrude. She says she only reads when she really has nothing else to enjoy. That would be entirely praiseworthy if she did not at the same time pose as a “cultured” person and venture upon literary criticisms. </p>
		<p>B. came to tea and read Creighton while I finished type-writing my story.</p>
