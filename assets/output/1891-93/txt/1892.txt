Tree for children in morning. Emma taken ill. 
Walked with B. but unfortunately quarrelled — both our faults! 
But I went down to him in the evening and he came to me, and then came back and found me there. 
Saturday, January 2, 1892, Florence 
Called for B. and went for doctor and nurse in the morning. 
Children very trying in afternoon. 
came in the evening [0185] and we worked on our Titian.
Every girl ought to be made to spend six months taking care of little children before she marries. She would think twice before having children of her own!! 
The nurse came at 11! 
Children restless all night, and I horribly unhappy at being absent from B.

Uffizi.
Went to Ways to dinner. B. very sleepy. Mrs. Way beautifully dressed and [0186] milder in her flirtatiousness than before. She said she and her husband so thoroughly agreed with Mrs. Besant’s book on Population. I am sure if I had asked her which she recommended, the sponge or the syringe, she would have told me, sans gêne! Mr. Way said “It is better to be a pig than a prig,” and B., speaking of the English aristocracy, said it made a great difference whether you belonged to the Peerage or the Beerage. He said the patron Madonna of England is Our Lady of Grundy!
