Thursday, September 3, 1891, Hotel Roth, München
From Regensberg to Munich 8.18 - 11.45. Read Faust all the way. 
The Pinacothek from 1-2, just a glance at the Italian pictures. How lovely the Francia, and how matchless the Titian. Morelli compares it to the last works of Franz Hals. The Sodoma was delightful, and a small Correggio. 
 We were both secretly dying [sic] to get to the exhibition of modern French (and other) pictures, so, after a rest, we went to the Glaspalast and found some of our favourites of the Salon, as well as some new ones. Three Monets there, and four or five Manets, besides a new Besnard
 and two new Dagnau-Bouverets [0108] impressed us as wonderful, especially the Monets. Then there was a vast array of Böcklins and Lehnbachs, and any number of Americans, Spanish, Dutch, etc., to which we gave merely a hasty glance. 
The exhibition closed at 6 and we walked to the Propylaia and sat a long time on the steps of the Glyptothek, discussing the latest Parisian fad, the artistic society of the Rosy Cross founded by San Peladan in the interests of “Beauty”. I found the Besnard sunset disfigured by the pert, grinning girl in the foreground. B. said I would not feel so in ten years. We shall see! (n.b. I came round to his opinion in a day or two!!!!)
