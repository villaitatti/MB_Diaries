“Michael Field” went this morning. We have all enjoyed each other very much, and all of us have especially enjoyed “The Doctrine”, as we united in calling Bernhard. 
But it has been a curious three weeks. I have been ill, and so miserable I thought of killing myself, and if I could I would have killed Bernhard. I suppose, I know, I was crazy. I am getting better now, but I am rather feeble. I was at one time threatened with peritonitis and I had a good deal of pain. But that was nothing compared to the depression.
Bernhard has been most fascinating all the time. We have all been hanging on his words. 
A youth named Norman Hapgood has turned up from Harvard (a Law Student) and he, too, is of the faith. 
Meanwhile, my family affairs have been going forward, by the Vale of Tears. I wonder if there ever was a family that did not bring more pain than [0280] pleasure to the members thereof? No, of course the family was the best thing for its time, but now it is obsolete and so a terrible chain. We all tried to think last night of a single case in which the family experiment had turned out happily. We could not think of one. Miss Bradley said that if she were young she would not dare to marry, that she could not take it upon her conscience to found a thing she so thoroughly disapproved of. Edith we called “Liberanda”, because she is going to try to throw off her father’s yoke a little. 
Hapgood is as much oppressed as any woman. He has plenty of money, but his parents insist upon his going into a lawyer’s office in Chicago. He has grown apathetic from living too long in Cambridge. He says he knows it isn’t life, but he prefers Cambridge. Silly child!!
Well, I have had many letters from poor mother. I will copy extracts from some when I feel a little stronger.
Bôcher has been here, and I have seen Marion Lawrence once or twice, and Jens Th〈i〉is,
 the Norwegian youth who is trying to understand all the Arts in one year.
