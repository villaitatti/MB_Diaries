Creighton’s History of the Papacy,
 a birthday present from Mother, arrived, and Horatio Browne’s [sic] History of Venice.
 The latter we began to read at once. 
We went to see the Pontormos in the Collegio Militare.
I dined with the Carlisles. Lord Carlisle and Lady Mary’s husband, Mr. Murray, were particularly nice, although Lord Carlisle said that France had never produced a great man and that there was no such thing as painting now in Paris! It seemed awful to me to be living in such a rabble. Lady Carlisle ordering them all about, and fighting with her husband. O the joys of solitude!! 
Mr. Murray came back with me and came in to look at Perry’s History of Greek Literature.
