Read Motley going to Haarlem. 
Spent 2 1/2 hours in the Museum, studying Frans Hals, etc. We were perfectly fascinated with the two pictures nos. 77 & 78, painted in 1664 in a manner suggestive of Zorn and Carrière, but even more modern than either! Compared him to Shakspeare. Also found figures and treatment which Rembrandt must have copied.
The best Terburg, a Family Group, was painted very much like a Courtois. A landscape by Van der Velde was like a Hampstead Heath scene by Constable, but better! The Cornelius van Haarlems were all [0083] interesting, and the pictures by Jan de Braij, while under Frans Hals’ influence, were very good. A Regents picture by Pot was also extremely good, and some portraits by Verspronck. Compared evolution of Hals to Velasquez, beginning where Titian left off.
Went to Fodor Museum,
 an absolute fraud, 1 small Meissonier
 and a slight sketch by Watteau. 
… Walked through Ghetto.

A day in train from Amsterdam 9.30 to Hanover 8.50. Missed connections. Very hot and somewhat dusty. 
Read Motley all day and studied German.
