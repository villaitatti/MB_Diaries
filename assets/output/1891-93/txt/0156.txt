Monday, November 2, 1891, Stella d’Oro, Treviso 
I was so ill that we decided to drive, and we went out to S. Cristina and saw the interesting Lotto there. Then we saw the false Giorgione in the Monte di Pietà, and after luncheon we went to Motta di Livenza. We saw a beautiful, most uniquely quiet little spot, with a delightful Church out of the town, approached by an avenue beside a stream. The picture there is a puzzle – is it Savoldo or Pordenone?? 
Then we saw the Scarpa Gallery, and enjoyed some of the pictures immensely. 
We had dinner in the kitchen of a little inn, with the MOST BEAUTIFUL Giorgionesque hostess!!!! [0157] The settee running all round the deep fire-place, and the country yokels who came in and sat there in the shadow of the chimney with the firelight on their faces made an indescribably enjoyable ‘genre’ picture. 
Tuesday, November 3, 1891, Italia, Udine 
In the morning we saw several churches and finished the notes on the cathedral. 
Then we came to Pordenone and saw his pictures in the Duomo and the town hall, and then came here. 
Wednesday, November 4, 1891, Udine 
Visited the pictures. What a charming town, an inland, small copy of Venice, the town hall ever prettier than the Doge’s Palace. At sunset we climbed to the castle in the site of Attila’s stronghold, and saw the [0158] circle of mountains and the sunny plain. How beautiful it was!!
Bernhard thought of nothing all day but Giovanni, Martini, and Girolamo da Udine, and which, if any (or all) was or were Pellegrino di San Daniele. The problem remains unanswered!!

Thursday, November 5, 1891, Hotel Tegetthof, Vienna 
We met the Costas on the train at 7.50 and came on to Vienna, reaching it at 9.30. The carriages were comfortable and the scenery marvellous, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. 
We read Villiers de l’Isle Adam’s Nouveau Monde
 and Flaubert’s Trois Contes.
 
Giovanni had sweets, which served to beguile the journey.
