After lunch we went to the Gallery and then to the Duomo and took the 5.14 train to Venice. An American mother and daughter were in our carriage. We exchanged a few words with them. Their only idea of travelling was evidently scenery, and they compared Italy unfavourably with America and Switzerland.

Spent the morning in San Marco and the Doge’s Palace. 
I was tired in the afternoon and stayed in but Bernhard went to the Gallery. 
Read Charles V. 
Bernhard is reading Balbo’s History of Italy,
 and finds it good, though absurdly old-fashioned.

San Marco, San Giorgio in Bragora, the Scuola di San Giorgio Schiavoni, San Francesco della Vigna, San Giovanni e Paolo, and Santa Maria Formosa in the morning. 
San Giorgio Maggiore and San Giuseppe in Castello in the afternoon, and a gondola ride. 
Met the Americans being hurried about by a courier. 
Wrote our Morelli article.
