We spent the morning in the Chapel of the Arena, which is filled with Giotto’s frescoes. We were thoroughly surprised by the real beauty of all the compositions, by the delightful straight-forwardness and clearness of his stories and real appropriateness of his allegories. But we were even more struck by the real beauty of the frescoes as painting — the wonderful purity of the outlines and the daintiness yet richness of the colouring – and perhaps more than anything else – what is so rare in the old Masters – the sweep of his brush. Almost every stroke of this can be traced – and it shows a masterly skill and decision. The naïveté is [0142] very winning – and coupled with this is a delicious gaucherie, remarkably like that gaucherie which we also find in Japanese art. In a curious way his peasants, even to their clothes, and his way of treating landscape and animals, is also Japanese. Giotto as well as the Japanese looked upon a picture as the means of expressing an idea – so they mentally abbreviate the scene – simplify it. From one point of view, of course – the point of view of atmosphere – these pictures are as much bas-reliefs as if they were in marble – and this [0143] very simplicity is a quality which Giotto has in common with the bas-relief. This is simply saying that Giotto had not yet got free from the style of painting which was nothing but the Alexandrine bas-relief in paint. Certain things in these frescoes are types for the whole school – as, for instance, arranging the heads in a line – which is found throughout the whole Tuscan school. 
The sleeping soldiers and the resurrection may have been in Mantegna’s mind when he painted his Resurrection, and the composition of the Baptism is certainly identical with Bellini’s and Cima’s.
