Friday, September 29, 1893, Venice
Churches (I forget what) and Torcello in the afternoon. 
I went with Marion to see the “Serva Amorosa” by Goldoni, and enjoyed it immensely. What is natural acting in Italy is the humble stage convention in England. Here it is the very life, but adapted; there it is the very thing Hamlet lectured the players against.

Academy, Santa Catarina, Madonna dell’Orto. 
Bernhard’s proof came and we corrected them. Great fun seeing first book in print.
