Christina and I went to the Uffizi, and Bernhard took old Miss Forbes there. 
After my German lesson we went out to the Certosa, and walked home. On the way I said (one of my rare and infrequent thoughtful remarks!) that methodism is Protestant Jesuitism. 
In the evening we finished Ghosts.

Worked on Lotto in the morning. 
Then Bernhard went to “Vernon Lee’s” to lunch, and met Mr. Benn,
 whom he liked. Mr. Benn said that ‘Americans took a merely feminine interest in ideas’, and he enjoyed Bernhard’s description of Michelet as a person ‘who had only loafer ideas’. 
I met Christina in the Medici Tombs and after lunch we went up to Fiesole where we met Bernhard. We walked again to Settignano. We met a man who had literally fallen on the road with hunger, and helped him to a farm-house and bought him wine and bread, which he devoured greedily, forgetting to thank us, which showed he was not a professional beggar, at least.
In the evening I read aloud Hedda Gabler.
