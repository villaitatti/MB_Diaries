I called on Marion Lawrence and her mother, and met Bernhard and “Fafnir” (as we call Hapgood) at the Carmini at noon. 
In the afternoon they went to the Lido and I took the Massinghams to Sir Henry Layard’s, the Sina Palace, and Santa Maria dei Miracoli. They were enchanted, and I think I got them a little de-Ruskinized. 
Ray on reaching Haslemere whispered to mother, “Is Mary here?”
