Met Costa 〈at〉 Santa Maria Formosa, went to San Felice and Santa Maria in Orto. After lunch, to the Academy and then to look at a reported Lotto and a horrible private collection. 
It was dark and rainy and we had tea at Florian’s. 
Then B and I worked at an index for two hours, and then wrote to our mothers.
