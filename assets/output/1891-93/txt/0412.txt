Thursday, August 31, 1893, Munich
Somehow I have skipped a date and it is the 31st. I don’t understand it! The programme of the day was as usual. 
Friday, September 1, 1893, Munich
Stayed in and wrote “Giant” and Hampton Court Guide. 
Went to hear Tannhäuser which we enjoyed immensely, rather to our surprise. It is a very generous young work. He didn’t economize themes and situations. 
Saturday, September 2, 1893, Munich
Gallery, walked, and wrote as usual. 
Sunday, September 3, 1893, Munich
Eight years ago was my marriage-day, alas! 
We tried to go to Schleis〈s〉heim,
 but the train stopped running Sept. 1. So we went to the Gallery. 
After writing and a walk we heard Das Rheingold [0413] the shortest and most crowded full of music of all the Ring. It was well given and we enjoyed it. 
* Monday, September 4, 1893, Munich
Gallery and writing. 
Berenson said that Hapgood differed from most Americans in being willing to accept a truth when he saw it, without regard to God, the American Eagle, or any other abstractions. 
* Tuesday, September 5, 1893, Munich
Gallery, writing and reading. A long walk.
Wednesday, September 6, 1893, Munich
The New Gallery. 
Called on Mr. Bush.
Writing, etc. 
Thursday, September 7, 1893, Munich
Maude Mosher’s and John Robertson’s wedding day. I wonder how soon they will be separated or divorced?
We carried out our usual programme.
x Friday, September 8, 1893, Munich
Went to the Panorama of Rome. 
Heard “Götterdämmerung” in the evening. I was perfectly delighted with it, and felt that I would gladly hear all the Ring over again. 
Saturday, September 9, 1893, Café Central, Innsbruck
Came here by the 11.28. Read Ranke. 
We had a [0414] dreadful time finding rooms, for the town is crowded, and has been since June 4, with a Fair. One hotel keeper said he could not give us 3 single rooms, but he could give us one room with 3 beds! That man deserves to succeed in his business!!! 
 Sunday, September 10, 1893, * Hotel d’Ampezzo, Toblach
Saw the Gallery, etc. Came here.
[TRENTINO - ALTO ADIGE - VENETO]
Monday, September 11, 1893, * Aquila Nera, Cortina
Diligence to Schluderbach. Then we walked through the Dolomites here, about 15/16 miles. We enjoyed every step of the way, all three of us. It was a thoroughly delightful day. 
Tuesday, September 12, 1893, Hotel Venezia, Pieve di Cadore 
Diligence to Barca, walked to Venas. There I took the post here, but Hapgood and Berenson walked. I went to another hotel from the one arranged, and failed to catch them on the way, so they had a tiresome hunt. Bernhard was very cross. 
Saw the Church, etc.
