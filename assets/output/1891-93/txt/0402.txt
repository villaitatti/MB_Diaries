Wednesday, May 24, 1893, Albergo della Pace, Ancona
Went to Jesi. 
Returned to Ancona at 5 and Bernhard and I walked up to the Cathedral and saw a wonderful sunset. It suddenly came out under a heavy line of clouds and lighted up the town like a strange calcium light. Our rooms had fine views of the harbour, and were clean.

From Ancona here, 5.30 - 5.30 with an hour’s stop at Milan. 
“Michael Field” stayed behind to see Ancona and Rimini.
Friday, May 26, 1893, Bergamo 
Started for Sedrina at 8. Our horse jumped over a bridge and had a horrible fall into the stream below. Fortunately, he was not killed, nor we either!
Another carriage was found and went to Sedrina and saw a Lotto, then to Ponte Ranica
 for the same.
After lunch we revised the Lotto chronology, and went to S. Bernardino, Santo Spirito and the photographers!
Michael Field telegraphed from Forlì that they would not come till tomorrow. So much the better.
