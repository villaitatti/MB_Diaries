Sunday, January 10, 1892, Florence
Received Mr. Pennell’s article on the Vienna Gallery.
Went to the Bargello and afterwards to B.’s rooms, where we semi-quarrelled because he would not answer Mr. Pennell. He was an angel, and promised to write every day. 
In the afternoon I helped Gertrude get off to the Home, and we took a little walk together, and then came back and answered Mr. Pennell’s article, and sent it off to the Nation.
