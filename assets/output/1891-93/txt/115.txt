Took the night train to Verona. 
Read Richepin, Quatre petits Romans.
<Verona>
Wednesday, September 〈9〉 [10], 1891, Colombe d’Or, Verona 
Embankment broken, so we had to change cars at 5.30, walking a long way. The scenery was very fine. At Ala
 we found our train had gone on and we had 4 hours, so we went to a hotel in the town and had breakfast and a sleep. 
Reached Verona at 4.20. Walked to San Zeno and saw the cloisters. 
Took a stroll after dinner. 
Thursday, September 〈10〉 [11], 1891, Verona
In the morning (8.30-12) went to San Lorenzo, Santi Apostoli, Santa Euphemia, Santa Anastasia, the Duomo, and San [0116] Giorgio in Braida. 
After lunch and a rest, went to the Gallery and then to San Bernardino and came home by the Porta Palio.
Complete overwhelming of me, and discouraging of B. After such galleries as London and Berlin and Paris and Dresden, the pictures here seemed poor to him, and he confessed to preferring the copies in San Bernardino to the original Cavazzuolas in the Museo!! 
The architecture impresses me more than the pictures. There is so much beautiful colour about everything.
Read Charles V,
 studied German. 
B. “got up” Verona from Morelli, etc., etc.
