Friday, September 4, 1891, Hotel Roth, Munich
Went to gallery in morning and looked over the drawings. The only ones of note were the Fra Bartolommeos (especially a Head of a Woman); Mantegna, Madonna with an angel on each side; Sodoma, Virtues driving out Vices (analogous to Mantegna’s picture in the Louvre); some small Cupid pictures by Penni; a Mantegna, and a much destroyed Pollaijuolo.
Afterwards we studied the Italian pictures. B. disagrees with Morelli on several points: 1. That the so-called “Lionardo” is not Flemish but Italian, possibly an early Verocchio. 2. That the so-called Luini is not a Solario. 3. That the Paris Bordone Portrait is not much repainted. 4. [0110] That the Moretto is a Moretto, and not a Moroni.
Looked at the Dürer engravings.
After quarrelled slightly and then walked in the Park.

We took the 7 o’clock train to Augsburg. I read Faust all the way. 
Wandered about the town and saw the Cathedral. The stained glass windows of the 11th century mentioned by Baedeker exist only in his imagination. Cathedral filled with altar-pictures by German masters, best seemed to be by Burckmeyer.
At 9 went to the gallery and looked at the Italian pictures there. The most beautiful was a Tintoretto.
