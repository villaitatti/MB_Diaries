Sunday, October 4, 1891, Venice 
Met Costa at the Doge’s palace and studied the Tintorettos and Bassanos and the false Paul Veroneses.
In the afternoon we finished our great “Repertorio di Quadri Italiani” and read Villiers de Lisle Adam, and took a walk in the Public Garden, discussing education. 
Monday, October 5, 1891, Hotel Monaco, Venice 
Went to Santa Maria della Pietà, S. Francesco della Vigna, and San Matteo in the morning. Felt tired and went out to the Lido and had a good walk. I had a swim au naturel. The sea and sky were perfect.
Read Axël by Villiers de l’Isle Adam
 and Richepin’s Morts Bizarres
 and Venturi’s paper on the School of Modena.
