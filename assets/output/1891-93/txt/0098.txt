Gallery in morning. Took notes of pictures. 
Called on Miss Bradley (Michael Field) in the afternoon. 
Went to Götterdämmerung in the evening and enjoyed it even more than all the others. B. remarked that Wotan was unusually [0099] sensible for a god, for he retired when he perceived that he was obsolescent. 
B shaved off his beard!!!! 
* 〈Sunday〉 August 30, 1891, Dresden
Took 9.20 train to Pötscha and walked to the Bastei through fresh, mushroom smelling pine woods. 
After lunch we started to walk to Shaudan but took a cul-de-sac road which landed us in a beautiful woodland temple. Walked back to Rathen and thence to Pötscha, just catching the train. The day was warm and fresh, and the sunlight enchanting. It was a day to remember all our lives. As we got off the train B. saw preparations which made him think they were about to commit a statue in the square.
