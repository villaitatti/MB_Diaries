Salute, Gesuati, San Sebastiano and 〈Santa Maria dei〉 Carmini in morning. Doge’s Palace and Lido (where I had a swim).

xx Saturday, October 8, 1892, Venice
Santa Maria Zobenigo, San Stefano, San Fantino, S. Leo, S. Bartolomeo in Rialto, S. Giovanni Crisostomo, S. Cassiano, S. Giacomo in Orio in the morning. 
In the afternoon we went out to the Lido and I had a swim while Bernhard remained shivering on the shore, to my disgust. I quarrelled with him, but as it is no use being on bad terms with each other, we made it up. 
He read Balfour’s Essay in Progress, and found it destitute of ideas and very dull. 
In the evening I went on with my “Salons” and Bernhard read Eastlake.

Went to Correr, S. Marcuolo and S. Giobbe in the morning, and the Querini-Stampalia and Lido in the afternoon. I had a splendid swim. 
I read Balfour’s “Progress” and found it dreadfully insipid. 
Classified my notes in evening. 
At meals I read Charles V and Bernhard reads Eastlake.
