Pitti in the morning and finished re-writing our Paris Bordone. 
B. went to Costa’s and I took mother and Lady Albinia to the Uffizi, and then went to see Gertrude. 
Loeser came to dinner with us and we talked and looked at Lionardo drawings and talked — all of us rather bored, I fear.

Saturday, January 16, 1892. Florence
Finished the Venetians in the Pitti. 
B. went to see Costa and I to see Gertrude. 
He did not come to dinner, and I read Vol. I of Yriarte’s César Borgia.
 
B. invented the word “Pruritanic.” He went to hear Le Barbre de Seville with Loeser. 
Sunday, January 17, 1892, Florence 
Bargello in the morning. 
Tea with Loeser at 24 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Bernhard’s room, after the two had been to call on the Ways, a proceeding which they compared to a Turkish Bath. Bernhard said that Mrs. Way sighed delightfully. Loeser was rather nice. 
In the evening I read Layard and Crowe and Cavalcaselle on Lorenzo Monaco, and Prescott’s description of Charles VIII in Italy.
 
Missed Bernhard.
