Friday, October 16, 1891, Hotel Monaco, Venice 
Went to S. Giorgio dei [sic] Schiavoni and took full notes. The light was splendid between 10 and 12.30, in spite of Ruskin! 
Quarrelled dreadfully and B. went alone to the Ducal Palace. Then he came back for me, and we went with Costa to see Sir Henry Layard’s pictures again, and then to Guggenheim’s, to see the Tura.
 
Moonlight and gondola in the evening. I recited Matthew Arnold and Renan. 
Saturday, October 17, 1891, Venice
Went to San Trovaso and San Sebastiano. 
At 2 Costa called for us and we went to Santa Catharina, then to San Michele (Campo Santo) to see a picture Loeser described as a Savoldo, but which turned out to be a bad XVIII century picture. 
Then to San Donato Murano.
I went to call on Miss Bliss and B. to call on Mlle. Jackowska and Mlle. Mercier. 
I finished Mrs. Oliphant’s Makers of Venice. B. read Horatio Brown’s Venetian Studies.
