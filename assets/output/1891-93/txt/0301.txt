x Tuesday, September 27, 1892, Genoa
Went to S. Ambrogio and the Cathedral in the morning. I felt too tired to go on, but Bernhard went to the other churches and wandered all about the town. We went to the Doria Palace in the afternoon, and then came home and began to type-write our article on the Morelli Gallery. 
Went to bed early. Read Charles V. 
* Wednesday, September 28, 1892, Albergo Roma, Vicenza
Left Genoa at 6.30, reaching Milan at 9.30. 
After a caviar sandwich and a beer, we went to the Ambrosiana. I liked the Bassano best, and I discovered a Bartolomeo Veneto, only to find that Loeser had discovered it before. 
Then I went to the Museo Civico, while Bernhard went for photos to Marcozzi. I identified a Correggio, a Foppa, a Sodoma, a Beccaruzzi, a Brusasorci, an Antonello, a Licinio, a Cariani, a Morone, but made several mistakes, taking a Cariani portrait for a Cicinio, two Crivellis for false Crivellis, and a false Moroni for a real one. I know the general features of each school, but I am not a fine connoisseur yet. 
Saw the Davises at lunch. 
Vernon Lee and her friend were in the train. Bernhard had 5 minutes talk with her in which she mentioned staying with two countesses, and their possessions, and said Mrs. Zilleri was “only the daughter of a maid”. 
Arrived here 5.30.
