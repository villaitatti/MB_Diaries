Went with Hapgood to the Gallery and to the “Secession Ausstellung”, where we found most of our Champ de Mars friends. 
Wrote home. “Giant” for the children. 
Went to the New Pinacothek and were disgusted.

I wrote my Hampton Court Guide while the others went to the Bavarian Museum. 
We went to the Schack Gallery after lunch. Really, Lenbach’s copies of Titian are marvellous! 
Hapgood and I went to “Die Feen”
 in the evening. We found it poor, not Wagnerian, and not anything else except spectacular. Fancy fairies without harps!

Spent the morning over the Italian drawings. After writing a little, we took a lovely walk by the river and back through the park. 
Then, in honour of Goethe, we went to see Iphegenie in Tauris, which was well acted, according to German traditions!

Drawing again. Wrote “Giant” and Hampton Court Guide. 
Went to hear Tristan and Isolde, my first time, and Bernhard’s sixth. Frau Sucher sang. It surpasses all his other works.
