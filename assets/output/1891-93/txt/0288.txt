14 rue de la Grande Chaumière, Paris,  Tuesday, August 23, 1892,
I felt much worse and did not go out. Read Adolfe.
 
Went to Dr Laudonzy at 4. He said I had inflammation of the womb and ovaries, besides my stomach. He prescribed a very strict diet and absolute rest. I had a great deal of pain. 
Bernhard dined with Bôcher.

A dreadful day. I could not read, but bored myself all day and tormented both of us. I felt very unhappy.

Still on my back. Burke came in while we were at breakfast. Bernhard took him to Durand-Ruel’s to see the pictures he wants to buy.
After lunch they went to the Hotel de Ville. They liked the Lerolles.
 
I read La Bête Humaine.
 
I have read a great many of Zola’s novels. Let me see how many: L’Oeuvre,
 La Curée, Germinal, Nana, La Faute de l’Abbé Mouret, La Rêve, Pot-Bouille, La Joie de Vivre, Au Bonheur des Dames, Les Contes à Ninon.
 I do not remember any others. 
Bernhard is reading Germinie Lacerteux,
 and we are reading aloud, for the second time, Creighton’s History of the Papacy.
 
Burke came to tea.
