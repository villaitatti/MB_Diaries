Pitti in the morning. Bernhard wrote as usual and I gave Emma a rest, as she was quite worn out with Karin’s wakefulness. 
Parry came to tea at B.’s. 
Edith Kendall and her brother came to dine with me. They insisted on arguing about Women’s Rights. I only said one thing worth remembering, it was a comparison of the present waking up of women to the consciousness of personality to what happened in the Renaissance. 
B. called on Loeser.
