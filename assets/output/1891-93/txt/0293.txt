Thursday, September 8, 1892, Paris
Went to Louvre and met Hapgood and Thiis. Later Florentines and drawings. 
Bernhard took Prof. Bôcher to the Luxembourg and I took Frank Whitall and Will Nicholson (first cousins whose births I can remember, now tall young men with incipient moustaches!) to the Pharmacie, New Sorbonne, Hotel de Ville, etc. Frank, like so many intellectual Americans, knew about twice as much of what Art ought to be as people who have studied it for years!
In the evening we went for the third time to hear Les Troyens at the Opéra Comique. Marie Delna
 sang, more gloriously than ever, and we were simply enraptured with the music.

Louvre in the morning, Hapgood and Thiis. Umbrian School.
Lunched with Hapgood who came here and looked over the Lionardo book and talked. 
Then we drove with him in the Bois and Bernhard talked “doctrine” which Hapgood drank in. He is astonishingly honest and free from vanity.
We dined together. We discussed genre and came to the conclusion that the term has no meaning now. 
Bernhard compared the growth of Art to hair. It depends on the general state of the body (Society), yet has an independent growth from itself. It is a capital idea. I mean it clears up a great deal for me that had been confused.
I read Rosario
 in the evening, and Bernhard Charles Demailly.
