Sunday, November 13, 1892, Albergo Lucini, Spoleto
Saw the Pinacoteca at Foligno and the Ottaviano Nelli frescoes in the Municipio and came by the 10.30 train to Trevi, a desolate town in a sharp conical hill. There were Lo Spagnas to be seen, a fine altar by Rocco da Vicenza, and a good modern church. 
Lunch at a little trattoria was charged 3 francs. “Credo che due cinquanta è basta,” Bernhard said, and there was no opposition. The Italian way of doing business! 
It rained as we left Trevi in a carriage (8 francs), but cleared up and we saw the charming little Temple on the Clitannus, and the Springs, and some Lo Spagnas in S. Giacomo, these by candle-light. 
Arrived here to a hotel starred by Baedeker, which alas! has changed hands and is now fearfully poor. 
Monday, November 14, 1892, Europa, Terni 
Saw the Duomo with its splendid porch. 
A Canonico escorted us to the ruins, etc., and then sent us his two books, one against Darwinism and the other against cremation, with wishes for a “vita lunga e piena di felicità.”
Saw S. Agostino and S. Pietro in the afternoon and came here. 
Quarrelled, or rather were cross. The door of S. Pietro is splendid.
