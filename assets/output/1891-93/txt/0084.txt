Sunday, August 16, 1891, Brunswick
Came from Hanover. 
Studied German in train and began Tolstoi’s Wandelt im Licht.
 
Gallery closed. 
Saw town and churches and very nice recent buildings in Renaissance style, i.e., new Schloss, Theater, Police Court, etc. 
In the Dom the tomb of Henry the Lion and Matilda his wife (done about 1200) was very remarkable and beautiful. Her face was particularly lovely, and as well modelled as anything Greek!! Found it hard to understand.
At breakfast discussed the advantages, to a writer, of having no traditions to contend with, compared Dumas fils and Ibsen, Tolstoi and the Russian novelists with the Americans. 
Also the skill the rich get in objects of [0085] household art, such as furniture, tapestry, carpets, etc., but the rarity of their becoming connoisseurs in the higher arts. 
Goncourt puts it perfectly in his entry for samedi, 20 février 1875: 
“Les gens riches, il leur arrive parfois d’avoir du goût dans les porcelaines, dans les tapisseries, dans les meubles, dans les tabatières, dans les objets d’art industriel … il semble vraiment qu’aux richaios, sauf de très rares exceptions, est défendu le goût de l’art supérieur, — de l’art fait par les mains, qui ne sont plus des mains d’ouvrier.”
This is especially true of Americans, who really furnish their houses perfectly. However, they as buy good French pictures, or perhaps it is that they buy French pictures, and therefore can’t help getting good ones.
[in Bernhard’s hand]
