Sunday, September 13, 1891, Hotel Colombe d’Or, Verona
Went to the Gallery in the morning, but I was almost too ill to see anything. However, I enjoyed the Cavazzolas
 while B. studied his problems. 
Lay down the rest of the day, feeling pretty ill. 
B. went to San Stefano, the Duomo, San Siro e Libera, Santa Maria in Organo, Santa Chiara, and San Giovanni in Valle.
I read Prescott’s Ferdinand and Isabella
 and wrote to Evalyne.

Went to see fire-works in the Amphitheatre. 
Monday, September 14, 1891, Verona 
Went to San Stefano and studied the Brusasorci frescoes. 
Then to Santa Maria in Organo, where we met the sacristan whom B. liked so much a year and a half ago. He took us in the afternoon out to a church on a hill about 8 kilom〈etres〉 away in a little [121] village called Marcellise. There we discovered four fine Girolamo dei Libris. 
On the way back we stopped at a beautiful round church built by Sanmichele, called La Madonna della Campagna. There was a fine Farinati and some old frescoes inside, but the architecture was more wonderful than all!

Went to San Lorenzo and Santi Apostoli and to San Fermo.
