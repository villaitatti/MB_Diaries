Friday, December 18, 1891, Florence
Breakfast together. 
Went to the Ognissanti, Santa Maria Novella and S. Lorenzo. 
After lunch I wrote letters for Gertrude and the〈n〉 took tea with B. and Costa. 
B. had been at Alinari’s and calling on Miss Britten. 
In the evening we read Ruskin’s Ariadne Fiorentina, a book about engravings of Botticelli’s, chiefly done by tenth rate imitators of the people Ruskin detests most on earth – the Polaignoli!! [sic] He speaks of the Primavera and the Venus as tondos! and mixes up Mantegna and Castagno!
