Alas! we part today in London. I cannot bear to think of it, much as I want to see the children. Bernhard is so infinitely dearer to me, and I feel he needs me almost as much as I need him. He has been so enchanting these days. I feel as if we all ought to combine and take care of him, warding off every disagreeable thing, while he repays us, and more than repays us, by his enchanting conversation. The dear!!

* Monday, August 14, 1893, Hotel de la Paix, Amiens
We left London at 11, reaching here at 4. I had a terrible headache, but went out to see the Cathedral. 
On the whole, our stay in England has been pleasant. Bernhard made interesting friends, and I enjoyed the children and succeeded in getting a first-rate governess for them. 
But it is nice to be together again!
