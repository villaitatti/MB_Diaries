Wednesday, August 12, 1891, Amsterdam
Came from The Hague here. Read Motley. 
Went to Museum. Saw “Night Watch” B.B. said it was a poet’s attempt to translate a commonplace subject into verse, and that it was told better and more appropriately, on the whole, in the good prose of Van du Helst, Jardin, etc. 
Saw a Vermeer von Delft and other Rembrandts and Franz Hals. 
Very tired. 
Read more Motley. 
Walked in Kalverstraat. 
Discussed the ways of writing history, epic and documental.
