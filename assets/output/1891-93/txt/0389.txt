I took Michael Field to the Pitti in the morning, while Bernhard took his American party about to Churches, etc. He had a very wonderful time “expounding” the Orcagna frescoes to them. 
In the afternoon I took Edward Clifford and Bernhard took the Mikes to the Uffizi. 
He met Frizzoni, who told him of an unpublished journal of Lotto belonging to a priest in Rome! and so Bernhard went to dine with him to hear about it, calling on the Americans afterwards.

I took the Michaels to Prato, where we had a beautiful day. 
Bernhard took his Americans to see churches. 
Sunday, April 23, 1893, Florence
I took Michael to the Academy and Annunziata in the morning, and Bernhard took them to the Uffizi and S. Maria Novella in the afternoon, having ciceroned his Americans in the morning. Michael’s eye is so well educated on modern French painting that she cannot endure most Florentine pictures on account of their lack of tone.
