“Miss Bradley and Miss Cooper, the quaint English poets who have a sort of hope that two female poets ought to be worth one male. So they call themselves “Michael Field”, and believe that nobody would know from their verses that they are unmarried women.” B.B. (letter to his mother).
We went to the Louvre, after showing the Michaels through the Luxembourg. B. described the Manet as “la Prostitution Eternelle”.
We worked in the Louvre, and after lunch came home. 
After tea we read Lionardo and after dinner Bernhard gave some capital criticisms on Sight and Song which they took in very good part. He said that the rhythm in verse is like the orchestra in music, and that the single word has to be of the most distinct and direct kind to produce an impression not entirely overborne by the rhythm.

Studied drawings in Louvre. Bernhard discovered a Cariani. The Wateaus were enchanting. 
After lunch we joined Michael at the New Salon, and enjoyed Zorn and Besnard.
After tea Bernhard went to call on Mlle Madeleine Fleury, and came [0278] back saddened, because she was so ill. She has to leave Paris for two years. 
After dinner we talked and read Browning, while Edith Cooper “killed adjectives” in her notes, “The Doctrine”, as they call Bernhard, having declared that they ought not to be used in poetry, except when they were so vivid as to be alive.
Letters from home all these days which sadden me. They have no right to be unhappy over me. It is a horrible, unjustifiable tyranny. But I cannot help feeling it a little. I suppose I should not feel it at all, if it were not for my dull ache for Ray’s sweet [‘sweet’ deleted] presence.
