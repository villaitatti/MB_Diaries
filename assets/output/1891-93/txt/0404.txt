Saw the Champ de Mars, and were disappointed. It must be Chicago that has taken the heart out of this exposition. 
Called for Maude Mosher and brought her to lunch. She is thinking of marrying a dissipated Southerner, but we tried to persuade her not. We went back and had tea with her and called on her enchanting musical friend, Helen Hopekirk.
