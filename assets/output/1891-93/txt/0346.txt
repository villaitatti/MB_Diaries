We spent all our day over Lotto, doing practically nothing else, except a little reading. 
Bernhard walked to Santa Margherita.

Again Lotto absorbed us â€” completely! 
It was snowing, so we dined at home. I felt unhappy about Ray, but Bernhard did all he could to console me.

Bernhard went to the Uffizi with Miss Head, and I wrote necessary home letters. 
Had a German lesson, and afterwards walked over Bellosguardo. Coming home we saw about a hundred people leaning on the wall of the embankment, cheering a dozen ragamuffins who were sliding on the ice on the Arno. The crowd seemed to be there for the afternoon,showing that plenty of people had time to loaf, and that ice was a rarity. 
Costa called. It turns out that he is in agreement with Bernhard about that portrait of a young man in the Pitti. They both think it a Timoteo Viti.
 
In the evening we worked on Lotto.
