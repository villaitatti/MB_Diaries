Tuesday, September 1, 1891, Hotel Goldner Kreuz, Regensberg
An old inn. Delightfully large room. 
Pleasant journey from Dresden, 8.45 to 5.45. 
Finished Goncourt’s Journal, read Pierre Loti’s Le Livre de Pitié et de la Mort,
 et Villier de Lisle Adam’s Histoires insolites. 
Studied German. 
Read Charles V. 
Reached Ratisbon in time for a sunset on bridge over the Danube. Saw Cathedral, which had resemblances to Notre Dame de Paris. Late Gothic but on the whole good, for Gothic!
Sent notes on Frankfort to Michael Fields in evening.
