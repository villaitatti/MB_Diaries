Thursday, October 22, 1891, Venice 
I was ill, but went for a while to the Academy. 
Came home and read Venetian Studies. 
Rested in the afternoon and wrote. B. called on Mlle Jackowska. 
* Friday, October 23, 1891, Venice 
Went to Ducal Palace in morning, and to the Scuola di S. Rocco in the afternoon. 
Then I went to the Frari while B. went with Mlle Jackowska to see the paintings of a certain Swiss Baron. He was well bored.
I walked back with Costa along the Giudecca and discussed Sebastiano del Piombo and the great books B. is to write. 
Wrote and looked at photos in the evening. 
Saturday, October 24, 1891, Venice 
Finished our notes on the Ducal Palace, and then went to S. Giuliano and then met Costa at S. Giovanni Crisostomo. 
Then B. went to S. Simeone to see if the ‘Trinity’ there was by Catena or Benedetto Diana. [140] He decided it was Catena, under Botti’s repaint! 
He met Costa and me at S. Cassiano.
In the afternoon we all went to the Frari. 
I read Barbey d’Aurevilly’s Les Diaboliques. 
B. finished Bourget’s Sensations d’Italie, par un homme qui n’a pas de sensorium.

Sunday, October 25, 1891, Hotel Croce d’Oro, Padua 
Went to the Academy for a last look in the morning. 
Met the two Costas and arranged to go to Vienna on the 5th. Last look at St. Mark’s. 
We came in the 4 o’clock train to Padua and walked a little in the town before dinner and then spent the evening reading guide-books, etc., in preparation for our work here.
