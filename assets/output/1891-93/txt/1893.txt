* Sunday, January 1, 1893, Florence 
Read and walked up to San Miniato and enjoyed ourselves. 
We have both read Ranke’s History of the Popes,
 and Bernhard has read Philippson’s History of the Counter Reformation.
 I am hurrying up to learn German so that I can read it, and fill up the intellectual gulf that my ignorance of German creates between us. He has also read Merimée’s novel about Charles IX.
 
* Monday, January 2, 1893, Florence 
Read Ibsen’s new play, Master Builder Solness,
 but did not quite see through it. 
Walked and talked and were happy.
