We went to the Albertina in the morning and finished our notes. Afterwards we wrote about the gallery, and went to Löwy’s. 
In the evening we wrote and read.

We went first to the Lichtenstein, but it was closed, so we went again to the Academy. 
At 12.30 we went to the Richter concert, whose programme is below. The clavier-concert was perfect enchanting, like a picture of Watteau, just the same spirit. 
In the afternoon Herr Wick〈h〉off and Mrs. Morison called, and we wrote in the evening.
Two traits have developed themselves today chez les Americains. They went out this afternoon to visit the Cemetery, a thing Americans never miss! 
The other [0173] national note is the way they treat their tutor. Having hired him, they use him tout à fait comme leur courrier. Tonight he had to leave his supper and take the maid to the train for Paris. And he is an Oxford man, far more of a gentleman in every way than anyone they are likely to know in America. They are true barbarians from the point of view of culture. He must be horrified a hundred times a day!
