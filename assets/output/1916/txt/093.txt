  Geoffrey Scott, Naima Löfroth
  Glorious 
  Mrs. Kryal and Miss Flint (the dancing teacher) came to lunch. I was very sleepy. Geoffrey and Marcella went to the Laghetto from 4-8. It left him still amused and still cynical. She is famous for a hair, but vowed she never lied Geoffrey anyone “con cui stava.” Symptomatic remark. 
  B.B. and Naima and I had a glorious walk in the heights. It was really beautiful.
  Bernard has begun to write “A appreciation of Leonardo’s paintings.” It may be very amusing. If only he wrote better it would be really delicious.
