  BB at Sybil’s in the afternoon. 
  Lina and I went to the “Mid-summer Night Dream” at the Gregory Smith’s, acted, in parts charmingly, by Miss Penrose’s pupils. Mrs. Krayl caught me there and proceeded to have a terrific scene about Cecil. She is fearfully in love, very self-centred and very hysterical. I told her she absolutely must try to get over it, as Cecil had no use for her, and she was in fact on his nerves.
