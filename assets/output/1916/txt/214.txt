  Walked to the Lago, where the car motored us and brought us down. 
  Lazzaroni came to lunch and Prince Paul to dinner. B.B. told the latter that he couldn’t return to England while the war was on, but being a Prince must act like one and go out to the Serbian Army at Salonica. The poor boy hates it so, especially as he isn’t wanted there, and all his relatives work against him. And he longs so for England! But English people would never understand his leaving his country now.
