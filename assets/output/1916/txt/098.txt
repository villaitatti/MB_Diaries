  Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott, Naima LÃ¶froth
  Grey then fine
  Dr. Crescenzi came to lunch and he and Naima and B.B. and I had a walk on the down from S. Clemente: divine. 
  There seems no chance of it, but I wish Naima might catch him. She wants to, and he is a very nice, good man. 
  Geoffrey feels rather flat and foolish, having preached so much, yet encouraging Marcella to continue seeing him in secret and lying about it, it on the ground that it is a noble and fine relation, whim he suspects is just like the others, but with more sex intensity. It is all rather foolish, though human.
