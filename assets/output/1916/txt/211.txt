  Geoffrey Scott
  Hot
  Geoffrey and I came up here to prospect. It is a heavenly air and the food is good. I have telephoned to B.B. to come up. 
  Geoffrey had a talk with Yoï, he asked her why she had sent back his presents, and she retorted by asking him why he hadn’t kept his appointment with her. 
  He said that he didn’t care to stand in Hutton’s way. She professed complete surprise, and told so many lies that at last Geoffrey said Hutton had practically said he was her lover which is a hundred times true. He quoted what I reported as having heard Hutton say - “that there wasn’t a trace of childbirth on her body”, as this seemed more conclusive than any of his vapourings about elopements to Spain and the rest.
