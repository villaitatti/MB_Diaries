Friday, February 1, 1916, Ray’s, London
Last furious fight at dressmakers’. The jacket was so awful that they saw it would not do, although they “couldn’t understand it - such a thing had never happened before.”
  Alys had a farewell tea, but I felt very ill and had to go to a Dr. (MacNaughton 33 upper Belgrave St.) who syringed my ear and gave me things for my neck and shoulder. 
  I saw however Jo Robinson and Louise Kinsella and the Whitalls. Barbara (the angel) was there. 
  Emily and Ray and I dined, and A. had the inspiration of giving us some warmed-over mutton (horrible) as her farewell feast. The food is the worst any of us encountered anywhere. She is too economical. 
  Called on Lawsons, who, as usual, are at their last penny. She gets £__ a week as head of 
the Nurses’ hostel.
