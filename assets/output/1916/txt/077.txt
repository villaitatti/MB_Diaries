  Called on Mrs. Ross and Lina. 
  BB went to Sybil’s. She is very ill. 
  He came in the morning and told me a tale she had had from a soldier who saw it. In the Flanders’ offensive last October a German General was wounded and as his division had to retreat…., he was left behind lying in a field between the oncoming English and the Germans who had reformed to shoot. A terrific storm of bullets rattled over him, into the midst of which a young English officer ran and picked up the General and brought him back to the German lines, and handed him over to the 2nd officer. This man (though a Bosch) was so moved that he snatched off his Iron Cross and pinned it into breast of the Englishman, who then walked quickly back to his own side. Not a shot was fired for half an hour after. 
  B.B and I cried like children. 
  Miss Hayes, a bouncing, vulgar, looking young giantess of 17 and her companion, a charming Iris Hiseman of about 80, came to lunch.
