  Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Nora Grifeo
  Drove up and walked back behind Morgans’. 
  Geoffrey agitatedly waiting all day for the phone message, which didn’t come till late, as Marcella went to sleep after one all night at the hospital. He is in a rotten state.
  Lady and Miss Methuen, Sybil, French and the boys came to dine, Mr. and Mrs. Hulton afterward.
  Nora has begun to pour her woes into Geoffrey’s ear, as B.B. and I aren’t sympathetic enough.
