Sunday, August 5, Villa Bice, Massa di Marina [sic]
  Geoffrey Scott, Sybil Cutting, Iris, ourselves
  Started at 7.30 and got here in the car at 12. 
  Found Sybil on the beach - and our lazy life began. All morning in bathing and perhaps bathing again! 
  Sybil is wonderfully better.
  I fear Iâ€™ve caught a cold.
