  Geoffrey Scott 
  Glorious motor run to Arezzo no. 6 a lovely road. 
  Left Cecil there and came home by Reggello etc. also very lovely.
  Geoffrey growing rather cynical about Marcella Michela and her “high purposes” and low actions. It is the best way for him to treat what must be a non-permanent affair, a flirtation. It seems to amuse him and make him happy, although he is really too genuine a person to stand it very long.
