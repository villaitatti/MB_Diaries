Saturday, February 12, 1916, Ray’s, London
  Alys went off at 8:35 from Euston. She is going to N.Y. second class on a second-class steamer! 
  Eliza and I had a last row at the dressmaker’s over the bluse which cost £2.2 and is so badly made that I can hardly wear it. 
  Lunched with Karin and said goodbye. 
  Called on Mrs. Strong. 
  Went with Ray to see her Exhibition of Vanessa’s pictures, quite horrible. 
  The MacLagans were there, full of disgust.
