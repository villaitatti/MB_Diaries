  Rain 
  Sore throat again. Stayed in bed all morning.  
  Countess Serristori came, full of adoration for Germany even for its Socialism, although that is the thing she used to dread most of all in life! She things England is engineering the whole war for her own sole advantage, stopping at no dirty trick of bribery. Blackmail and cruelty and lying to accomplish her ends. Germany for her is the Land of Promise, the model and only hope of the future. She said England was on its last leg financially and was cited “The Union of Democratic Control” as proof that it was all falling to pieces. What a fool Adrian is to be in such a society. Even if its motives seem pure to him, it is mixed up with such treason. I have no patience with it.

  Cecil Pinsent
  Windy and damp but a little sunshine 
  Great buzz from Geoffrey over Cecil’s visit, as it would perhaps hinder him from seeing Marcella before she goes to Spain, if he waited for Cecil in Paris. He thinks it is my fault, but I had heard nothing of his plans since I left, and furthermore could not alter the date, as it is fixed by Cecil meeting Strong at Genoa on the 25th. While I really believe it is poison to him to go on with Marcella, whose awesome anabaptism makes her august and admirable but very dangerous, I do sympathize with young blood that needs its sfogo. 
  So without saying a word about it to Cecil, I hope I managed for him to meet Geoffrey at Turin instead of Paris. Marcella on her side made a muddle, writing to me that she could not come up till the end of next week, meaning this week. And now I have arranged all sorts of conflicting things for this weekend. 
  Trench and his daughter Aris came to dine, Cecil, the Marainis. 
  Yoï is determined to have our villino, but she won’t get it!
