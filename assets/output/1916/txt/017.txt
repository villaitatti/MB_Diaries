Julia, Geoffrey Scott
Glorious cooler
3 lunch, 3 dinner 
  Dismissed the cook. What a bore. 
  B.B drove and walked with Sybil. 
  Geoffrey and I motored to Terzano, behind Bagno a Ripoli, and then walked over the Incontro to Villamagna. It was absolutely DIVINE. For the first time since it began, I think, I forgot about the war for several hours on end. 
  Geoffrey on the unending theme, but he is always subtle, amusing, kind and profound. He really isn’t much in love, though she’s awfully nice. Curious how these things go. 
  Left him at Byba’s, and he dined at Sybil’s, where I called to pick up B.B and say goodbye to Lady Limerick and Capt. Perry.
