Saturday, August 19, 1916, Hotel Radio, Equi
  Motoring with Geoffrey Scott and Lina Waterfield
  Storm and fine
  Motored over the pass back from Pian della Gotta and had a ** most glorious view of the Apuan mountains. 
  Saw the little XVIII century Library (archivio) at Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, and went up into the heart of the Monte Pisanino to a little place called Vagli Superiore, where we lunched. 
  Reached Equi for tea, and explored the cavern and the cave full of the bones of prehistoric men and animals. 
  Lina has observed poor little Hutton’s passion for Yoï, and she talked to me about it. I said I thought Yoï wouldn’t upset everybody’s applecart for him. Lina was awfully concerned and distressed.
