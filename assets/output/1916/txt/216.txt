  I went down to the Counsul’s and found that there are many difficulties in the way of travel. 
  After our awful struggle we decided not to go to America, but to remain here till the end of the war. 
  I don’t see how I can bear not to go to England: It is awful for me. But I am tremendously relieved about America. To go and amuse ourselves with fashionable life there in war-time would have been intolerable.
