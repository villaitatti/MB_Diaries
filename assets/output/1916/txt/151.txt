  Geoffrey Scott, Naima Löfroth
  Scirocco
  A quiet day such as I like and corrected proofs, and Geoffrey, who wastes too much time! Since Marcella Michela came on the scene he has really form rather slack. 
  BB had tea with Sybil, and Geoffrey and I walked on Monte Senario. 
  Sybil is still going on about Nora’s visit. Lucky she doesn’t know about this silly ugly business with Miss Belle Greene.
