  Fine
  Went to Santa Croce in morning but B.B. was so cross about a baby that cried and a guardian who had a cold and sniffed that it was (for me) all spoiled. He was also perfectly and absolutely unreasonable about the chest of drawers. I think he half believes that the boys were extra careless about it because it was for him! 
  A perfect hopelessness came over me of ever getting behind his furious and unreasonable “complexes,” and having him see things straight. It is truly very sad and painful.
  Mrs. Ross and Hutton dined here. We spoke of the War.
