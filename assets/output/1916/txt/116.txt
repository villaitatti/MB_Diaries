  Fine
  They went just after lunch. B.B. having taken Alice to the Pitti and ‘thaught her to see with his eyes.’ 
  Bakst finished a second sketch of Teresa before going. 
  A Mr. George Plaisted, Harvard Institute scholar came. awful accent, seemed not like a gentleman, but intelligent and rather nice. Would love to go and fight the Germans. 
  Took Geoffrey, Teresa and her mother to call on Mrs. Mitchell and see his roses. I liked him a little. 
  Geoffrey went to the theatre with Teresa and the Sfornis to see Ibsen’s Doll’s House, which we used to thrill over 31 years ago, Mary Nimis, A__ Shaw, the Webbs, the Cobden Sandersons and all of us. It is a good acting play still but the theme seemed vieux jeu. 
  The Dumonts dined here.
  I went for Plaisted about his accent.
