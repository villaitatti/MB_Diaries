  Nora Grifeo, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent 
  Hot
  Motored out to the Mugello (Panicaglia near Borgo San Lorenzo), to see Princess Candriano (Noraâ€™s cousin) in the indescribably hideous little villino she has been building for herself in a lovely spot.
  Ate our dinner on the pass by the stream. Lovely.
  The English offensive makes my heart stunned still. All that murder and pain and wretchedness: How can men?
  Prince Paul and the Placcis came to dine and Hutton. Placci was horrid.
