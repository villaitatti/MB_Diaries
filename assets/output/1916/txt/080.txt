  Rain, sun Rainstorm 
  Today BB and I had a walk, and then the Countess Serristori came. We all cried at the thought of the war. We could talk about it, it was a strain. 
  BB dined with Sybil. He had a letter from Belle Greene, who wants to come to Italy, but BB doesnâ€™t want her to on account of Sybil!!
