  Elisabetta Henraux, Geoffrey Scott
  Elizabetta Geoffrey and I spent the afternoon at Caserta, seeing the Gardens and Palace, and dining at the de Piccolellis place at S. Nicola, when the strange old grandfather lived for 20 years after his wife deserted him. We enjoyed it very much. 
  Bernard went to Aversa to see the Vanni there, and dined with Nora.
