6 <at> lunch, 6 <at> dinner
  Wasted a good deal of time (if it is waste) walking with Geoffrey. I hope it clears his mind and fortifies him: but I see him doomed to great unhappiness in the affair in which he is embarked. However, probably even Something with an unhappy ending is better than Nothing, for the Young.   
  We went with Lina and Gordon and Julia to the Actons’ children’s party - a badly managed affair with too many vulgar flirting Florentines at it, crowding out the children.  
  Walter Dowdeswell came to dine and was very clownish and amusing, telling ghost stories and reciting comic poems.
