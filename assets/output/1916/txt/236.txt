  Scirocco
  Heavy day indexing, and dress-making. 
  Walked in the woods, dripping with sweat, but it did us good. 
  Marcella Michela called on Geoffrey and was quite intolerable. She never attempts to control her moods. I daresay he was difficile, too. She said she was sure there wasn’t even a friendship left, as they had taken a strada sbagliata - and then they fell to quarreling about Italy and England. 
  On the whole, it is just as well, for it would certainly queer the Nippy pitch if they went on with the intensità which they started in when she came back from her holiday.
  This is Tuesday’s tale
