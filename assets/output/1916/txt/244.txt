  Glorious
  Fearful day of indecision about going home. B.B. is so against it, so afraid, somehow of being left alone, and so far from well, that I gave in and said I would not go, if he felt he really couldn’t spare me. 
  But there must be something he doesn’t say, some “complex” about having given up Belle Greene, and wanting me to give up as much - or something I don’t understand to account for the violence on his expressions.
  I am utterly worn out with it. 
  We took THE walk and found it very beautiful. He seemed to get happy when I said I would not go if he felt so strongly about it. 
  But it does seem to using my heart most horribly.
