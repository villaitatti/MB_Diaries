Sunday, October 1, 1916, I Tatti
  Naima Löfroth
  Fine and then a little rain
  Got on well with Index of Vol. III of Study and Criticism.
  We all went to have tea at the Villa Pazzi with Mr. Eyre and Viola and her husband and took the Arbuthouts home. 
  Reading George Moore’s The Brook Kerith which is perfectly delightful.
