  Motored Teresa to Vallombrosa, and while B.B. called on Dowdeswell and the Serristoris, Hutton and Geoffrey and I had a 2 hours climb over the mountains in the dark, cool fragment pine-wood, alive with the buzz and hum of insects. We dined on our favorite promontory and got home at 11.
  Hutton seemed depressed and no longer confident about Yoï, although they are planning to spend some weeks at Vallombrosa in the same hotel. Yoï particularly stipulating that she should have a room apart for her nurse and babies, and Hutton re-impressing this on me when I went to speak about her rooms. But he talks less ecstatic nonsense than he did, and thinks perhaps she is fond of Nello and her children! Poor little man.
