3 <at> lunch, <at> 9 dinner 
  The boys gave a children’s party to which also Naima and Lina went, but I didn’t. I had a walk alone, trying to compose my mind and soul, and B.B. had a walk with Sybil. If one’s feelings could only harmonize with one’s judgment.
  Capt. Perry came to tea, and Mr. and Mrs. Trench, Mr. Dumonts, the boys, and Lina to dinner. 
  Geoffrey stayed and talked and talked till nearly 2. Perhaps it helps him to see clearly, but that does have so little influence on actions and feelings!
