Friday, February 18, 1916, Paris
  In bed with a cold verging on influenza. 
  Long conferences with Geoffrey who is working round to saying frankly that he wants to be free to marry Nikky if he finds they both care for each other. This is only fair to Marcella who is letting herself be swept along on the full tide of attraction - perhaps love - though she writes “Tu es le premier perle de mon collier rèvè”: significant words!!
  Mme de Cossé came to see me. She said Edith was to be decorée - who really deserves it - and by herself not is the general group of American helpers.
  Finished Spoon River Anthology and Well’s Research Magnificent - a book so close to one’s pulse, but so disgustingly common-placifying [sic]. Makes one quite uncomfortable. Edith doesn’t feel this.
