  Nails and dress occupied Juliaâ€™s morning, while I interviewed cooks, etc. 
  B.B. and I walked from the Tree to Fiesole. 
  Prince Paul, Miss Hulton, Aunt Janet, Lina, and the boys dined here. Aunt Janet brought her photographs albums and the Prince was much interested to meet a person who had known Thacheray and Dickens and Meredith and Kinglake, and de Lesseps and Ferdinaso (as they call him) of Bulgaria.
