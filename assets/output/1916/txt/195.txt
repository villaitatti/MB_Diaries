Friday, August 18, 1916, Hotel Appennino, Pian della Gotta, Garfagnana
  Lina motoring 
  Fine and then storm
  Started about 11, having hung sound an extra half hour on the chance of Geoffrey receiving the longed-for letter.
  Motored from Massa to Carrara - Fosdinovo - Fivizzano, where we had an excellent lunch. Then to Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, where the bibliotecario was away, of course! 
  Then up the Pass towards Pieve Pelago, taking tea in the chestnut woods. 
  Arriving at Pian della Gottta we could get beds only in the house of the arciprete, but these were clean and nice. We heard him moving overhead - he was putting biscuit tins in crucial spots to prevent the rain coming through onto the beds. 
  Geoffrey is very glad he came, as it distracts him from worrying.
