  Teresa Hulton, Geoffrey Scott
  Called on Aunt Janet. B.B. and Sybil. 
  Teresa Hulton came to dine and stay, and Geoffrey came late. He had telegraphed that he would sleep in town, and I discreetly did not meet him, thinking Marcella probably was coming to see him. But he telephoned up at 9 and begged me to send. 
  He and Cecil saw over the huge Fiat works in Turin.
