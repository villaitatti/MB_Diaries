Dump and grey 
Julia, Geoffey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
5 lunch, 3 dinner
  Took Julia to the Academy and Pitti. She forgot her spectacles, but doesn’t care much anyhow for old pictures, and did not seem to want to know why people liked them. I did not force her. 
  I left her at Villa Medici and Geoffrey and I walked home through the woods. 
  B.B. dined with Sybil. A heavy cold overcame me, but I took about 10 remedies:
1. turkish bath 
2. purge
3. quinine
4. asperine 
5. gargle listerine
6. dioxygen 
7. Nasal douche of Dobell’s solution
8. Rhinitis etc. in nose 
9. Cold throat compress 
10. Hot drink 
  Quarrelled with Geoffrey over the never settled question of punctuality. I daresay I am too fussy, and I must try to be more easy-going for fussiness defeat the end for which punctuality exists, i.e. to grease the machinery of life!
