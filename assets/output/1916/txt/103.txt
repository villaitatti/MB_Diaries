  Clouds, fine
  Poor Horne died at 2 o’clock last night, peacefully. Santina, his servant, said that soon before he died he reached out and grasped an imaginary hand and patted it. She thought it was Bernard’s. We were the only people he saw yesterday. It meant a great deal to him to be reconciled with B.B. We were just in time - and how fortunate I got him to make his will.
  Teresa Hulton came and she and I had a walk on Monte Senario while BB called on Sybil.
