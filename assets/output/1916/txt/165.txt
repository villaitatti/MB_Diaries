  Geoffrey told of how he went well to Strongs and found him in contemplation of the cupola of the Duomo. “
  I have been THINKING these last few days why that cupola is beautiful, and now I know”    “Why is it?”

  Cecil presented his accounts. He was 800 pounds out in his Library estimates. B.B. is furious and lets out his fury on me, fortunately.
  A Black Serpent Day.
