Sunday, May 21, 1916, Hotel Bertolini, Naples
  Elizabetta Henraux 
  Divine
  We saw the bronzes in the morning. I cannot like the Dionysos head. 
  B.B. and I had tea with Donna Nora Grifeo (Ruffo), and then we drove out to Posillipo etc. – a lovely evening. 
  Elisabetta who belongs to an old Neapolitan family, recounts les gestes de sa famille in a quiet matter – if - fact way – 
  “My grandmother, who was married at 16, ran off with the Duca di Bovino leaving my aunt a baby of six weeks. Of course my grandfather never forgave her. He burnt up everything she had ever touched and left Naples forever. He struck my father once, who never spoke to him again for 30 years”.
