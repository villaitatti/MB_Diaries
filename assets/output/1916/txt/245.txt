  Fine
  The mystery was explained by a telegram for him which was brought to me - from Belle Greene saying that since he couldn’t come to London she would come and stay with him for two weeks in Paris. He had given up London - not for me, but because he couldn’t stand her friend there and the flirtations with them - and he felt bored and depressed and so couldn’t spare me, not even for a most sacred duty of mine and one I cared about awfully. Another reason for me to love that vulgar young person!
  However her coming decides him to go to Paris, so I am graciously allowed to go too.
  As the chief thing I want is to go, I am in the whole glad, but the whole comedy disgusts me and it seems to me very selfish to make me pay for the ennui he feels on her accounts. Still I am glad to go.
