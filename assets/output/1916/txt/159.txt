  Cecil went to Rome to take his oath-put on khaki. 
  BB and I called on Aunt Janet who is ill with bronchitis. 
  At 7 the Guadagnis came (mother-father- and 2 big boys). Iris took the boys to the Laghetto, while the rest of us and Miss Methuen, saw the house and walked in the garden. The Marchesa Guadagni is an enormous, handsome, vehement, despotic but foolish woman. One would dislike her perhaps, but I feel sorry for her, as she had melancholia for 5 years, with an obsession on the subject of mattresses, which hasn’t entirely left her, for she brings them in as regularly as Brockwell did “The Trustees of the National Gallery”.
   Sybil and Mr. Trench made up an out-of-door dinner of 12. It was a relief when they all went.
