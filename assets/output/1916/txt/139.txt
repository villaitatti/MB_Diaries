Thursday, June,1, 1916, Naples to Fiuggi
  Geoffrey Scott
  Rain and shine
  We left Naples at 9.30 and saw Capua – that fine “Easter Candle” in the Duomo, and the glorious Head of Capua that once adorned Frederick the Great’s Arch. It is more beautiful than the head at Ravello. 
  We saw Teano, too, but it scarcely repaid, except for the lovely country it is in. 
  We lunched on the hills, and then saw over Monte Cassino, with its sumptuous courts and terraces, and arrived here (*Albergo della Fonte) at 7.45
