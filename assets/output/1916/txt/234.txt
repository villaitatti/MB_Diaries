Monday, September 25, 1916, I Tatti
  Worked on Index.
B.B. dined with Sybil and I with Aunt Janet and Mr. Hutton. He walked back with me and said Yoï would leave Nello in an instant but for her passionate love for Fosco. 
  “It’s a long siege” he said “as long as the German War. But I shall win in the end” What does he went to win I wonder?
