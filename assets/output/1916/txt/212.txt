  B.B. and Naima came up to lunch and we had a long walk. 
  It is too beautiful. Met the Buttles and Andersens.
  Geoffrey had a further talk with Yo√Ø, which he said was too horrible for words. She threatened to make it impossible for him to live in Italy. She said he had never met such malignity and baseness.
