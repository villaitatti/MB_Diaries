[Thursday, January 20] 
  Julia, Geoffey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
  Bought Julia’s photos. Got passports etc. for all the children. 
  Yoï came to lunch. She seems old and dispirited and has no more joy in her. Her mother in-law has been here for months, and has been too much for her. She didn’t even flirt with Geoffrey! 
  Salvemini, Mme Luchaire and Sybil came to dine.
