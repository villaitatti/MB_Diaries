Sunday, June 18, 1916, I Tatti
  Geoffrey Scott, Naima LÃ¶froth
  Fine 
  Worked on Leonardo manuscript. 
  Marcella came up to tea and walked over with Geoffrey to dine with Sybil. 
  She was looking terribly beautiful, with a softer expression than I have ever seen. Geoffrey reported her as very full of good sense and consideration, quite aware she must give him up to Nicky. I hope she has the character to work it out well. 
  BB and I walked over the Incontro - a most lovely walk.
