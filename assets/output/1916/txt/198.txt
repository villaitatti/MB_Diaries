Monday, August 21, 1916, Marina di Massa
  Bathed twice.
  The Salveminis came to dinner. 
  We explored Bocca di Magra, a most lovely little fishing village, dominated by the Fabbricotti palaces - awful erections. What a divine country this is!
  Letter at last from Marcella Michela which, although it says nothing explicit, relieves Geoffreyâ€™s mind a lot. Most of it was - about two other men who are at her mountain resort!! What an impossible creature.
