Wednesday, March 29, Grand Hotel, Siena
  With Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott
  Nello and Yoï and Toesca and De Nicola came to lunch, Yoï pretty again but so false!    Then Geoffrey, Cecil and I motored over here. Cecil saw a man who offered to get us the sponge stone, but who was very mysterious about it.
