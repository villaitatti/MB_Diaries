  Eugénie Strong
  Shopped with Eugénie, an awful business, as she is so undecided about everything.
  Geoffrey had Marcella to dinner and rather raged at her for being neither a girl nor a woman. She is teasing, but cannot somehow really see it. I think she is a little cracked.
  B.B. stayed in bed all day.
  Eugenie and I called on Mrs. Ross.
