  Geoffrey Scott, Nora Grifeo
  Hot but less oppressive. Full Moon
  B.B. went to see Sybil, who is painfully ill with an infection of the mucous membrane.      Geoffrey took Nora over meaning to show her Strongs’ house, but she was so drugged that she fell asleep. Even awake she has been like a somnambulist all day. Poor little creature. I think of her as of a leaf in a whirling current setting toward a fire, tossed this way and that, but always nearer destruction. 
  Elizabetta came up, she, too, very anxious about Nora. Her state is indeed only too patent.
  Mr. Destrée and his second wife, Mr. and Mme de Pierron, came to tea. 
  We went to the Gamberaia after dinner. Lovely moonlight.
