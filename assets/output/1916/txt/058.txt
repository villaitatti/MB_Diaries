  In bed
  Mme de Coss√© called on me and dear Mrs. Cameron and Mrs. Royall Tyler - a snobbish, self-assertive, but very efficient lady. 
  Geoffrey dined with them to meet Vollard.

  Feeling very ill, worse. 
  Weissmann came. He says I can leave on Saturday only. 
  I sent off his letter about Nikky which he read to me. Very wise and sincere but goodness I think it will be of no use at all when they meet.
