  Geoffrey Scott
  Geoffrey woke up cured (he thinks!). Speriamo. But I donâ€™t for one instant think it. 
  We three walked round the top of Monte Ceceri, meeting dull Mr. Hulton on the way.     Called on Sybil and Geoffrey stayed to dine. 
  Mme. Henraux dined here. I got an impression of her being rather heavy and less spirituelle than I had thought.
