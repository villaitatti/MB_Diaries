  Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent 
  Glorious 
  Correcting BB’s proofs in morning. 
  Went to town and did many errands, including 4 for BB who says I never do a single thing for him (!!) and called on the Dumonts. She passes the limit for folly. 
  Marcella brought up Tenente Tuterio to walk in the woods and then dine (BB dined with Sybil), and told Geoffrey she would be here at 6.30. Of course she was one hour late, and it upset him so he was like a bear with jealously all the evening, especially at the Gamberaia, when we went after dinner to see it by moonlight. It was thoroughly disagreeable and uncomfortable, for Tuterio, though more correct in his demeanour was no less jealous. 
  “Volta pericolosa” should be put up in large letters when tant young woman appears, as Salvemini said. Geoffrey had a fiendish night before regaining his composure. It was to be expected.
