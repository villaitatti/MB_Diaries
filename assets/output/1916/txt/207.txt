  B.B. in bed, really seasick.
  I went to town with Aunt Janet and Hutton, and to Fiesole to get our permessi di soggiorno. 
  Hutton said that when Nello appeared in Vallombrosa he and Yoï were having tea together, and the maid rushed in saying “C’è il marito!” and Yoï said “Good God”. 
  She went to meet him and brought him in, and he and Hutton glared at each other “Three minutes by the clock”. 
  He also told this to Geoffrey. 
  Nello then decided to be friendly, and in the end told him he hoped he would go often to see Yoï.
