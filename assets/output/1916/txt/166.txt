Wednesday, July 5, 1916, I Tatti
   Geoffrey Scott, Nora Grifeo, Cecil Pinsent 
  Went out to the Pass to the Mugello and Hutton and I got out and had a 2 hours walk joining the others at that divine spot, Candigliana, where we had dinner. 
  The others were Geoffrey and Yoï, who came with us, and spent their time agreeably philandering (Yoï is a sotter!), and both Sybil and Iris who came later.
  Geoffrey seems safe, and this is distraction from that peril, Marcella.
  Sybil had been for a midnight ride till 2 in Trench’s ‘puffer,’ and was consequently very ill. She has no judgment about things she can safely do with her delicate health.
