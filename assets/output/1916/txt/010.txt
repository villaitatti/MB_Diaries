Glorious day, very warm
4 <at> lunch, 3 <at> dinner 
  De Nicola came to see B.B. Geoffrey and I had a morning walk in the laghetto, an exceptional affair, because of the exceptional day. 
  De Nicola stayed to lunch. He was at the Front at Plava,but lacked all power to tell about anything. 
  I motored him down and Geoffrey. We picked up Marcella Michela and I took them towards Bagni a Ripoli and started them on a walk — much better for them there stuffing indoors. She looked very beautiful and I felt drawn to her. I think if I were in Geoffrey’s place my head would be turned, but he seems to keep his balance miraculously. Long may it last. 
  Called on Yoï where I met her sister and Byba. 
  Picked up Julia and Gordon at Villa Medici. 
  B.B and I alone
