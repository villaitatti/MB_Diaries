  Naima Löfroth, Geoffrey Scott
  Full moon
  Nora dripped off at two o’clock. I shall miss Valdetta, but I am too thankful Nora is gone. It made me awfully uncomfortable to know she was drugging herself into imbecility (one saw it only too well!), and yet to be able to do nothing for her. I could hardly look at the dear little child without tears.
  Naima came back to tea – and the Dumonts to dine on the Gamberaia terrace. It was beautiful, but their talk was awful.
  Geoffrey and I walked home, but it wasn’t very pleasant, as I had to complain of his being selfish about my family affection. I don’t want him to be like B.B. and always put difficulties in the way of my going home, and generally show dislike of my fondness for my own family. It has always made things somewhat difficult, and I cannot have Geoffrey going the same way. He is selfish of them – they want me to be exclusively devoted to them. It only makes friction, for I can’t yield there – it is too vital to me. But how I do hate to stand up for myself in criticizing the people I love.
