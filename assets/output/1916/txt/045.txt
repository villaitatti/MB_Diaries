Monday, February 7, 1916, Loganâ€™s, London, with Barbara
  Went with Logan to Chilling and found Alys there since 2 days doing what she could to hurry on the dilatory workers who had promised to have everything ready to put the furniture in place. 
  It was very lovely there, with Constable effects of sky are the meadows and Sound. A really heavenly spot.
