  Peggy James came to lunch and told us that her uncle Henry had been conscious for a few minutes to receive the Order of Merit from Lord Bryce. He knows nothing of the War. Even when he thinks he is in Paris, he is only to be going around with Daudet. 
  Alys and I, after shopping for the girls, called on Mildred Minturn Scott to see Geoffrey’s mother. Mildred’s hair had just been dyed a vivid copper. Her silhouette against her light looked rather attractive, but her house was untidy and the general unhappiness was disagreeable. Mrs. Scott looked much older, poor darling old lady, but kept up her gaiety and spirit. She is a marvel. 
  Called on Sulley.
