  Tea at Palazzo Ruffo, where Nora’s mother, the Duchessa di Guardia Lombarda, had invited some very hideous and very swell Neapolitans. Nora had asked B.B. to come and see her for a very particular talk she had to have, but evidently took offence at his going for 10 minutes to her Mother’s, for she wouldn’t see him, and scarcely spoke to him when we all dined there, and had her Mother came in to spoil everything.
