  Drove to Forno - an awful road. 
  Bathed twice. 
  B.B. and I both feel very depressed. Sea air I suppose.
  However Geoffrey is magnificent, but he seems greatly bothered by hearing nothing from Marcella Michela.
  Sybil has developed her tiresome side again. I never can like her for more than a little while at a time, for she always does some incredibly self-absorbed a tactless thing, which gets on my nerves. At present she is just eating B.B. like a female spider, and he is wretched. And Lord how she chatters! I get wild just with the sound of her voice.
