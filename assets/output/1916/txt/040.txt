Thursday, February 3, 1916, At Ray’s, in London
  Saw Karin - lunched with Emily whose situation remains the same, a sometimes very cross and nagging and extremely garrulous mother who never goes out and won’t be left alone a minute. But Emily has bravely made turns with her narrow life. 
  We went to the National Gallery and saw Mrs. Glenny who was copying a picture - I hadn’t seen her since 13 years ago when we stayed with her in Buffalo. She was then rich and beautiful and strong and surrounded by friends. She is now poor, her fat face all pulled out of shape by paralysis, husband, and lovely daughter Alice dead, living with the other daughter and a singing teacher in lodgings - It was ghostly to see her. 
  Percy Lubbock came to dine at Aly’s. He was awfully nice, so quiet and serene, and so honest, not pretending to know or judge about matters he wasn’t fully informed about. If we could all be like that - !
