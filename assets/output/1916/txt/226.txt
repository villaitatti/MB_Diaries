  Had an awful row with B.B. because I want to go home for Ray’s confinement. If I do, he will go to America, and I want anything but that. He is awfully selfish. Certainly I should let him go anywhere he liked for a month. It hurts awfully. He says he has put all his eggs in one basket (me) and alas he behaves so that they are added! I am really miserable. 
  Prince Paul came to call before going to Racconigi to visit the Queen and go with her to the Front.
