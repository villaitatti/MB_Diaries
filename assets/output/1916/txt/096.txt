  Rain or shine 
  Geoffrey and I agreed to talk less of the Marcella business. He thinks I saved him from falling in love with a very unsuitable person; but now the moment has come to stop gossip over it. He seems to me like a fly in a spider’s net, a weak fly and strong net. What he calls his “preliminary obfuscating talk” never convinces me. But he has a fond of practical sense that may save him, although with suffering. His cynical talk about being Top Dog doesn’t persuade me quite. 
  Yoï and all the family came to lunch. It was Nello’s 30th birthday. She seemed very shoddy and 2nd rate. 
  I called on poor Horne, who is surely dying. He is all broken up with illness. I shall send him things. 
  Called about a Mrs. Price at Villa Capponi, fat and horsey, but a good sort. 
  Called on Sybil to pick up B.B. She seems very ill, poor thing. 
  Marcella spent the afternoon with Geoffrey at his flat. I did wonder what her mother 
thinks of it all.

  Marcella came bobbing up at Geoffrey’s almost as if nothing had passed, telling him she was just off to see one of her young men, and writing a note to another to say she couldn’t come till tomorrow! She said he didn’t “understand” and she was awfully grieved, but admitted she had gone almost straight from yesterday’s painful interview to pass the evening with one of her young men friends. The good about her is that she makes on scenes. But I suspect that, seeing that Geoffrey doesn’t break into her, she sets down the next as “pi-jaw”. She is very obstinate, and of course she’ll begin to deceive him now where she can. 
  Sophie Serristori came to lunch. 
 I went to see Horne, who seems to me dying, and Yoï, who is bounding up again with the prospect of Nello’s being called as a soldier.
