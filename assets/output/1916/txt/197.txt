  Fine
  We went up to the end of the road to see the cliffs and the awful peak Aubrey climbed. 
  Got to Aulla at 11 and while Lina saw her friends, Geoffrey and I motored to Bagnone, talking of course chiefly about Marcella Michela
  Came back by Sarzana, where we saw the Cathedral. 
  My cold is getting well at last. 
  Came over Fosdinovo - Carrara Pass on which we met B.B. and Sybil in her car. 
  Stopped at Fosdinovo and saw the churches and chatted with the Priest, whose nurse was full of profughi from the earthquake at Pesaro. One woman still looked awfully scared.
