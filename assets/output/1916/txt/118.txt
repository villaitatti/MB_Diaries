Friday, May 12, 1916, Palace Hotel, Perugia
  We left after lunch and motored here. It is a wretched hotel compared to the old Bonfani, which is now closed on account of the War. 
  We came a new road, over the hills from Cortona to La Magione, though a pass ablaze with golden broom. 
  This was May 16.
