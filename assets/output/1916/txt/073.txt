  Talked with Bernard. He cares a lot about Miss Greene but would give her up if I made a row. I donâ€™t like though to cut off a thing (however silly it seems to me) that may be vital to him. It is difficult, for I do detest the whole business. But if it makes Bernard feel alive and keeps him interested, I suppose I have no right to cut it off especially having let him go into it. 
  Called on Aunt Janet, who suddenly looks very old. 
  Prince Paul and Placci came to dine. The turkey was very tough!
