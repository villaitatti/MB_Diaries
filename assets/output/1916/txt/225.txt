  Naima Löfroth, Geoffrey Scott
  Fine
  Marcella came up to tea, and she and Geoffrey had their usual secret and extra-shaking talks. He will never understand her, but it’s fun trying and gives him a feelings of adventure and non-ennui.
  The Salveminis came to dine.
  B.B. talked with Geoffrey about the chest, and Geoffrey said it had been Cecil’s mistake, that they would take it themselves and have another made for him which should have the right measurements. But B.B. already loves the nice piece, and wants to keep it and yet declares he will keep his grievance too. 
  Geoffrey was awfully angry, and I think with reason.
