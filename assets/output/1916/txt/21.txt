  Cool 
  Dreadful reaction after the momentous decision. I am utterly miserable about England, but B.B. hung the two things together. 
  The Dumonts and Aunt Janet and Hutton dined here. I begin to suspect Hutton’s good faith, or rather, I am sure he is and ever worse confusionista than I. For he told Geoffrey he only confessed to me his love for Yoï, when I said I knew about his letters to her. This time I am sure of my ground. We never mentioned the letters till the second “Yoï” walk, and then he told me of having written. But it is a good reason to give Yoï for having spoken to me, and he clutches at it, and perhaps, in his trouble and muddle, believes it. He said I forced his confidence, and that is not true at all. But it is better to keep out of such things. Let it be a warning.
