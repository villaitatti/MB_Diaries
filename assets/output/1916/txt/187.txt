Tuesday, August 8, Massa
  Really ill. Fever and influenza.
[188-189]
Wednesday-Thursday, August 9-10, Marina di Massa
  Really wretched, not struggling up, bathing and eating, but so uncomfortable. Being unstrung. Sybil’s continual chatter does get on my nerves, although I like her more the more I see her. She is a good sort. B.B. seems shrunk from her endless talk. 
  Geoffrey has taken to this life like a fish. Sunburnt and well he looks. 
[190-191] 
Friday-Saturday, August 11-12, Villa Bice
  Still the same, a lazy but I trust restful life, but I am deep down under the gloom of Influenza.
  Drove to Forte and called on Lina and the Cansuleos. What a ghostly slum they’ve made of Forte.
