  Julia’s 15° birthday I hope she passed it happily.
  Karin saved Adrian from the military Tribunal by the skin of his teeth, by sending word to the Army representative there that when he was courting her and she urged him to fight, he dared to risk the loss of her suspect by refusing. This was the only point that established his antebellum conscentious objection to war. She is very bright. 
  Adrian makes a poor impression on Alys and Logan and Ray and Oliver.
