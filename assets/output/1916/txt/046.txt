Tuesday, February 8, 1916, Ray’s, London
  Went with Ray to see her surgeon who advises on operation (with abdominal incision) to remove a small fibroid growth in the womb, which may prevent pregnancy. If Ray could only have it now. I could see her though, but she is very busy till the 20th over their Annual Meeting. Great indecision. 
  Met Brockwell at Burlington Fine Arts Club and afterwards he took me to see Sir Hugh P. Lane’s Titian (Portrait of Baldassarre Castiglione in black) at his house in Cheyne Walk, now inhabited by his sister, Mrs. Schein and Lady Gregory, a delicious little old lady with sweet eyes and mind, Victorian aspect, was there. 
  Called on Karin, who lives in such a piggish way that it makes me quite uncomfortable to go there. It is like Mary Houghton. She and Adrian are so much in love that they apparently notice nothing, Adrian seems to me very incompetent - not very agreeable – except to Karin) 
  Dined with Gutekunsts.
