Saturday, May 20, 1916, Hotel Bertolini, Naples
  with Geoffrey Scott
  We all went to the Museum. Carlo at last got hold of his Duca di Eboli, who gave us a letter to see the new things at Pompei. 
  We lunched at the Umberto in the Galleria, fairly good. 
  Placci left â€“ and we others drove out and had tea on the crater of the Lake of Avernus and then on through the Arco Felice to Cumae. We climbed that divine hill and enjoyed ourselves enormously.
