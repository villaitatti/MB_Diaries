  Hutton came to ask where he could find ass’s milk for Yoï’s baby, who is ill. 
  B.B. rushed out of the room to keep himself from saying “Look in for your own breast”.   Hutton and I telephoned here and there, but couldn’t discover any. “I must get it!” and he actually proposed to send a town crier through the streets of Florence to cry for it. In the end he was persuaded not to, but went off on a quest. It found it might be got at Dicomano, and was starting off but telephoned, and told him to tell Nello and let Nello go for it if he wanted it, as it is his child, and Nello’s parents are very rich. 
  B.B. had tea with Sybil, and I called for him and we walked home. He said Sybil was very sensible and nice about seeing less of him and making no claims. He had to explain to her that he couldn’t go on as he did last winter, but I trust he did so very gently. 
  The boys dined with the Trenches.
