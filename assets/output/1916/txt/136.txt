  Saw some Churches in the morning and the Hospital and S. Giovanni Carbonaro with Nora in the afternoon. 
  B.B. was tired, so Geoffrey and I dined alone at Renzo Lucia’s, near San Martino, a lovely place. We ate Elizabetta’s famous cheeses, which made a real Epoch in our lives Mascarponi I think they’re called.
