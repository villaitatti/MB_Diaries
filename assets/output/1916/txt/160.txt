Friday, June 30, 1916, I Tatti
  Geoffrey Scott, Nora Grifeo, Guido Cagnola
  Went to the Madonna del Sasso with Lina and Mr. Hutton and Geoffrey and Yoï, while Guido Cagnola (who unexpectedly appeared) and Nora and BB came with Sybil. 
  Lina and Hutton and I had a god walk first, to the top, which us thoroughly enjoyed. Geoffrey and Yoï sat talking chastely over past joy which neither is in the mood for renewing. 
  The Salveminis came to lunch, married at last.
  B.B. received an anonymous letter saying Marcella was Geoffrey’s mistress.
A message from Marcella was waiting for Geoffrey that she couldn’t go on their expedition tomorrow, and he mustn’t telephone. He feels into a fearful state of jealousy, as he knew Malvano was back, and telephoned at once, but she was out. He was like a semi crazy person all night. Yet he says the affair is as “as dead as mutton”
