Monday, February 14, 1916, Hotel Terminus, Paris
  An awful crossing of 6 hours, everyone violently sea-sick. Things on the boat and dock so badly arranged that it made me blush for human incompetence. We stood for hours in the cold, crowded and furious, waiting to have our passports seen. 
  Arrived in Paris at 1 a.m.
