  Gaetano Salvemini 
  Divine

  Geoffrey went down to receive Marcella who had been spending the afternoon with “Mattia”. What a silly girl, acting on the barest sex impulses and talking such long-aided talk about the linea estetica of her inner life, etc. I am getting rather bored with her, though Geoffrey lives on it. 
  Ferrando and his tragic lady-love and their Belgian guest, and young painter named Jeanne, came to dine.
