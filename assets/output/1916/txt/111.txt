  Geoffrey Scott, Mrs. Garrett, Walter Berry, Leon Bakst
  Fine
  Had a walk with B.B., who is nearly at the end of his “Leonardo”.
  He dined alone, but Mrs. Garrett, <Walter> Berry  and <Léon>and Bakst arrived soon after dinner, having sent her maid before-hand with 3 carriage – wads of trunks. 
  I chaperoned Theresa Hulton and Marcella at a dinner at the boy’s, to which also Prince Paul came. 
  Marcella was very silent and distraite, with her dress skipping off her shoulders and leaving her nearly naked. She looked very pretty and very much in love. “John will walk” this time. 
  Geoffrey had a letter from Byba saying Nicky was really coming this summer. It upset him a lot, and so did Marcella’s silence; so that I fear what may happen. It’s really very silly, as they aren’t a bit congenial, and Nicky might be. It seems a crisis in his affairs, but I daresay he’ll pull through.
  Called on Mrs. Laurie and Mrs. Robertson, of the Scottish Hospital Service, and brought them out here. They’ve collected a hundred thousand francs for their work
