  Very cold, rainy
  I called for Beatrice Horne and brought her up to tea. She is silent, but seems friendly. She came too late to see her brother. 
  Took Geoffrey over to dine with Sybil, who is a little better, and picked up. B.B. there, who hurried home to write his Leonardo-scandal.
 Our cook is richiamato, woe is me. He was just getting satisfactory.
