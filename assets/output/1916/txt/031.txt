Tuesday, January 25, 1916, Ray’s London
  Hours on the quai at Southampton and reached London only at 4 o’clock. Came straight to Aly’s.
  Went on to see Karin and her little baby whom Adrian wants to name AN (!) 
  Karin had the folly to take only one room in the place she found for herself (I had a lovely nursing-home ready for her, so she is disturbed by the nurse and baby. But as she is perfectly well, it doesn’t so much matter. 
  Came out to Barbara’s bath “It’s Granma Mary!” she shouted – and then she said “Two Granmas, Granma Mary and Gramma Auntilu (to Aly’s grand delight). She turned somersaults and swam “like a mermaid” in her bath, and was heavenly, and adorable.
