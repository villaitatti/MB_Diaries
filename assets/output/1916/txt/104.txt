  Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Naima Löfroth, Miss Hulton
  Fine cold
  B.B. and I, with Herbert Trench went to Horne’s funeral at the Protestant Cemetery.
L’assistance was composed of “Sods” and dealers, very typical of one side of the poor fellow’s life. 
  Trench was full of a new “great” poem he had just composed, and Loeser was heard to say “when I marry again, I shall marry a deaf-mute”. 
  No one wept, no one cared as much as I did. I think, unless it was that unspeakable little mini Collingwood Gee. It seemed rather tragic, but at least he is no longer suffering.  
  Geoffrey took Miss Hulton a walk in the Laghetto. 
  The Marainis and Prince Paul joined on party of 6 at dinner. Nello was furiously jealousy, and Yoï whispered to Geoffrey that he had made her an awful scene. 
  Undercurrents run strong, but were dissipated by music. Teresa plays beautifully, and she is a beautiful creature.
