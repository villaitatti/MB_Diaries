  Lovely day
  Reinach came and took me to call on Miss Nathalie Barney. A pre-historic (and stuffy) milieu à la Stenbock (poor fellow) with the most hideous paintings and sculptures done by some female artists patronaged by her. Hot incense very strong, mélange of cheap Eastern things, good silver and flowers, white furs, pictures of nude or intense females everywhere. 
  She has an incorrigible “way-back.” American twang, a good-natured, warm manners, is no longer pretty, and not at all tidy. 
  The house was crowded and not dainty, all except the best bedroom (a circular Empire one) where she said Yoï made her decision to never away from her husband. 
  The Tylers and Ch. Du Bos came here to tea. 
  Byba wrote to Geoffrey that Nikky was coming back this Spring. Fearful upset, for the Marcella business is going ahead and he hates the idea of giving it up. If Nikky had only waited a year -“or 18 months.” But he mustn’t spoil his future. He is miserable.
