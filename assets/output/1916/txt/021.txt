Glorious  
Julia, Naima Löfroth, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
  
  3 lunch, 6 dinner 
  Decided about the pergola etc. with the boys, chiefly repairing Aubrey Waterfield’s original mistakes. He knew nothing about planning a garden! 
  Julia lunched with the Arbuthnots, and I went to get her, after having had a long and beautiful walk with B.B, back from “The Tree” to Fiesole. He said he had tried to help Sybil about her appalling self-absorbition, but she spends so much time and ingenuity proving to him that she isn’t self-absorbed, that he is bored and disgusted with the whole thing. She said that he made her afraid of him, she could care so much more for him and give him so much more if it weren’t for that - and he nearly cried out “You give me too much already!” 
  She spends hours, too, talking to Cecil and Geoffrey to refute B.B.’s accusation of being self-absorbed - just the proof that she is.
