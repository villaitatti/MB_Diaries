Monday, January 10, 1916, I Tatti
Julia, Geoffrey Scott
Glorious. Warm: 
4 lunch, 4 dinner 
  Such a day! A marvel of marvels. But I couldn’t employ it well, as I had engagements. 
  I took Lina and Gordon and Julia to the Pitti — what a poor lot of pictures with a few gems — the Granduca, the Dama Velata, the Aretino and the “Young Englishman” and parts of the Concert and of the Rubens. Goodness how one changes! 
  We called on Sir Thomas Dich Lauder (out) and Lady Enniskillen who talked a lot of gossip. 
  Tea’d, shopped, and picked up Geoffrey, who had had a visit from Marcella Michela
  Cook difficulties, as usual, since that devil Aristea left. 
  Long talk with Geoffrey. Such things are endless
