  Geoffrey Scott 
  Grey
  Ray telegraphed that her operation is postponed. Though she will have another baby without it. Her perfect nurse-housekeeper, Florence, is leaving her, on account of ill-health. Geoffrey still very much â€¦ though he tries to pretend he is not. I foresee great trouble for him unless he recovers.
  Miss Flint, a teacher of dancing, and Mrs. Krayl called. 
  Miss Hulton and her young male Gino Villari dined here. She played, and the music upset Geoffrey as it always does people in love.
