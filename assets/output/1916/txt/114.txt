  Went to Uffizi with the party. Alice Garrett is almost too stupid. But she is nice too. 
  Yoï and Nello came up to lunch, and we had a great show of Alice’s dresses afterwards. She has some pretty ones. Bakst superintended and gave interesting criticisms.
  The Actons, Lady Enniskillen, Countess d’Ossay, Countess Robilant and the Marchese Antinori came to tea. Quite meaningless. 
  We had a dull dinner at Sybil, but Miss de Roebeck played splendidly, and also Teresa, with whom Bakst fell more in love. He wants to paint her.
