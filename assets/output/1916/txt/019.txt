Julia, Geoffrey Scott
Cold rain 
4 lunch, 4 dinner 
  Miss Grace Hubbard to lunch, an earnest person, seeking to be fair and honest in her thoughts and views. We all liked her. 
  Called on Loesers with Mrs. Dumonts and Geoffrey, B.B and Sybil. 
  Salvermini and Mme Luchaire to dine. Talked of the ideal api-cultural Italy, which no one wants. 
  Geoffrey dined at Sybil who held long discorsi to prove that B.B was quite wrong in saying she was “self-absorbed”
