  Geoffrey Scott
  Took Mrs. Ross and Lina to lunch with the Dowdeswells. Ghastly. 
  Called on Mr. Dumont. 
  Walked with BB, who dined with Sybil. 
  Geoffrey came very late from one of those earth shaking interviews with Marcella which change everything and put things on an entirely new footing 
- au fond, changing nothing, but precipitating in down the inevitable path
-meanwhile, and by the way, making you an impossible member of ordinary society.
