  I went down to see Miss Priestly at her hospital. I saw a man whose jaw and tongue had been shot off, and others who have lost limbs, especially from frost-bite. I took there some Fels Naptha soap, the best cleaning soap there is.
  Then I called for Miss Cochrane and brought her up to lunch. She has some sort of spiritistic crank at the back up her head, the old goose. I took her to Mrs. Ross. 
  B.B and Naima took a walk and Geoffrey spent the day with M.M., who seems a nicer person than she did at first. 
  Julia had a day in bed, as it was her first monthly time, poor child.
