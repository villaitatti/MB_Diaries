  Glorious
  Nice to be home, though I feel considerably froissée to find BB, having spent all his time with Sybil, planning to go also this afternoon. I let him go without saying anything, for what is the use? 
  I walked in the garden and much enjoyed it. 
  Ray received the Queen at their workshops, and it went off very well, owing to Ray’s happy inspiration to take her where nothing was prepared for her reception and when she sat on a chair without a seat and drank tea and out a broken cup and ate cake off the lid of a tin box. 
  Ray thinks she is going to have a baby and won’t need the operation. What a blessing. 
  Barbara nearly knows has to read!
