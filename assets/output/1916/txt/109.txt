  Naima LÃ¶froth, Geoffrey Scott 
  Fine 
  We walked to the Madonna del Sasso, B.B. Naima and I, and at the bottom of the road we met by the Marchesa Guadagni and her 4 boys, and brought in. They were too curious about it to bear it any longer. She is a handsome, vigorous original woman, of a truly English type, frank-talking, indiscreet overbearing, eccentric, but nice. Her husband seems a cretin. 
  We took her boy back to Florence in the car, a great giant of 17. 
  The walk was glorious.
