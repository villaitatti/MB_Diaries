  Geoffrey Scott
  Grey cold
  B.B. and I had a long delightful walk in the woods, as he wants to dine with Sybil and there had per miracolo an afternoon free.
  Alys wired that she had got safely to England, not being torpedoed on the Atlantic, and that Barbara was “enchanting”. That I will believe, and I loved to read it.
  Geoffrey received Marcella for one of her determined and lengthy tête-a-tête, but she was nicer this time, and I read Italian poetry with him, and was intelligent and __, instead of spending all her time spooning. He liked it better, for his method of lovemaking is like the Snark’s method of Charity: “She collects but she does not subscribe”. 
  He came back very pleased. But I can see that both of them are heading for a stormy “affair” all the same, I hope it will keep off till I go to America, for I don’t like the young woman, and I feel sure she will make Geoffrey unhappy. But perhaps even unhappiness is better than ‘nothing doing.’
