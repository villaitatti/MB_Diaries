		<p>Wednesday, August 30, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  B.B. in bed, really seasick.</p>
		<p>  I went to town with Aunt Janet and Hutton, and to Fiesole to get our permessi di soggiorno. </p>
		<p>  Hutton said that when Nello appeared in Vallombrosa he and Yoï were having tea together, and the maid rushed in saying “C’è il marito!” and Yoï said “Good God”. </p>
		<p>  She went to meet him and brought him in, and he and Hutton glared at each other “Three minutes by the clock”. </p>
		<p>  He also told this to Geoffrey. </p>
		<p>  Nello then decided to be friendly, and in the end told him he hoped he would go often to see Yoï. </p>
