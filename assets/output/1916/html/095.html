		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Fine </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey getting exasperated with Marcellaâ€™s self-absorption and her rotten sex attitude. He is teasing and disappointing. He finds her not very interesting. The more freely she chatters on about herself, the more he dislikes her whole attitude. All the same, her peculiar sex freaks have got a hold on him and he is getting rather obsessed by that eminently unsatisfactory side of the business. She makes him feel cynical and cruel. It is really a horrid way to act, and she deserves to suffer. Unfortunately if she suffers, then he will be drawn in by the human and nice side of him. But he is vexed and bored now, but alas, in a way, caught. Not seeing her today made him very uneasy and irritable. </p>
		<p>  Flora Priestley came to spend the day and we walked to Monte Senario. Glorious. </p>
