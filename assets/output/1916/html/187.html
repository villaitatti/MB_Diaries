		<p>Tuesday, August 8, Massa</p>
		<p>  Really ill. Fever and influenza.</p>
		<p>[188-189]</p>
		<p>Wednesday-Thursday, August 9-10, Marina di Massa</p>
		<p>  Really wretched, not struggling up, bathing and eating, but so uncomfortable. Being unstrung. Sybil’s continual chatter does get on my nerves, although I like her more the more I see her. She is a good sort. B.B. seems shrunk from her endless talk. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey has taken to this life like a fish. Sunburnt and well he looks. </p>
		<p>[190-191] </p>
		<p>Friday-Saturday, August 11-12, Villa Bice</p>
		<p>  Still the same, a lazy but I trust restful life, but I am deep down under the gloom of Influenza.</p>
		<p>  Drove to Forte and called on Lina and the Cansuleos. What a ghostly slum they’ve made of Forte.</p>
