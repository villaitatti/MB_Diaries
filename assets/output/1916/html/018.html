		<p>Wednesday, January 12, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Splendid weather </p>
		<p>5 lunch, 3 dinner </p>
		<p>  No cook but Amerigo managed somehow.</p>
		<p>  I went in to the Carrels, taking Mrs. Ross to call on Miss Murray, and we then called for Miss Prestley whom I brought back to lunch. </p>
		<p>  We had a glorious walk over the down for S. Clemente. Geoffrey had just heard that Marcella Michela has scarlet fever. He is sure to have caught it. It is a great disappointment. He called there and left flowers and a note, and then went to the Casa di Cura. </p>
