		<p>Monday, September 18, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  Perfectly miserable. I cannot bear not to go home. How can B.B. try to prevent me. It is sheer selfishness and lack of consideration for the best feelings I have. It is really too awful. But he threatens me with all sorts of awful consequences if I go, such as his staying in America, getting to hate I Tatti, never trusting me again etc. etc. </p>
		<p>  And as he is clearly the main business of my life, on which my happiness really depends, I must give in. I did hate to make him unhappy - only somehow I don’t believe he would be - what is a month? - and it sounds like crafty and furious talk to get his ends. But why in hell does he want me to stay when it makes me utterly miserable and besides makes me almost hate him and rage secretly against him all the time? It is so silly. It isn’t as if he had stayed <home> from America for me. He gave up the journey himself before I suggested it and because he found the annoyances of travel, and now he makes me, who don’t fear them, give up what is so fearfully vital to me. I can’t bear to think of Ray going through all that suffering without me. It is intolerable. </p>
