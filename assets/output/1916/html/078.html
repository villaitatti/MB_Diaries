		<p>  Cecil Pinsent, Marcella Michela</p>
		<p>  Rainy </p>
		<p>  Marcella Michela came up at 5, after I had had Flora Priestley all day. She is a dear but a great talker—I am however attached to her, which seldom happens to me with talkers. Marcella “performed” very brilliantly in the evening. We laughed and greatly enjoyed it, yet were somewhat chagrined that she wouldn’t pay the slightest attention to anything we said! Her use of language is delightful, and she observes characteristic and significant things with much wit, though not exactly humor. She is a gifted creature. </p>
		<p>  Poor little Miss Cohen also came to call. Marcella spoke of both Geoffrey and Marchesi as prétendants and mimicked their probable attitude towards each other. She also said she would be furiously jealous and couldn’t possibly share a man with another woman - unless it was Kitty Bosco. </p>
