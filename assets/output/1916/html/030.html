		<p>Monday, January 24, 1916, Havre to Southampton, Paris</p>
		<p>  Bribed children to sleep and had lunch with Edith Wharton. </p>
		<p>  Awful crowd on quai at Havre. Beastly arrangement. Should have had to sit up all night in corridor of boat but for an angelic American youth named Porter, who gave me his cabin. </p>
