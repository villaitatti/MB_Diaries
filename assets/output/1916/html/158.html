		<p>Wednesday, June 28, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Nora Grifeo</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  Went out with Nora and Prince Paul and Elizabetta and Mr. Douglas Brooks for a walk and dinner overlooking the Mugello. Such a beautiful evening, but we were almost cold!</p>
		<p>  It was Marcella’s 26° birthday (half my age!) and Geoffrey went to town to see her, but they had a quarrel over her pretense to be leading a life full of estetica which to the outsider seems to consist of an elaborate fabric of lies invented to contrive endless tête-a-tête with amorous young men. </p>
		<p>  She said this flat out, and she (naturally) didn’t like it as to her own life appears full of high purposes and noble striving. It is the incongruous mixture of ideals and facts which enrages Geoffrey and most of her friends. But they had a very dangerous reconciliation, I fear. </p>
