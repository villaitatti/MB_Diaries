		<p>Thursday, January 10, 1916, Ray’s, London</p>
		<p>  Shopped and saw Karin. </p>
		<p>  Called on Dr. Heath who whopped down on me a bill for £88 for treatment of Karin’s ear.     Called on Louis Duveen, who reported things in America as very flourishing. </p>
		<p>  Mr. and Mrs. Prodder to lunch. What a chatterer she is! </p>
		<p>  Went to hear Ray speak on her “Service for Women” scheme. She did it very well. </p>
		<p>  Then I went to the Whitalls who gave a little reception in my honor to all their young literary and artistic friends. It was a charming atmosphere of Youth. Mrs. Colefax introduced a strident note. </p>
		<p>  Keynes came to dine at Ray’s. He signs cheques for a million pounds a day. He says the Italians are by far the most grasping and the most “impossible” of all the people they have to us with. I can’t believe it. </p>
		<p>  Got passport vise’d. </p>
