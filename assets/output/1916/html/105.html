		<p>Tuesday, April 18, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Very cold, rainy</p>
		<p>  I called for Beatrice Horne and brought her up to tea. She is silent, but seems friendly. She came too late to see her brother. </p>
		<p>  Took Geoffrey over to dine with Sybil, who is a little better, and picked up. B.B. there, who hurried home to write his Leonardo-scandal.</p>
		<p> Our cook is richiamato, woe is me. He was just getting satisfactory.</p>
