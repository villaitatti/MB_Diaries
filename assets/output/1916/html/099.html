		<p>Monday, April 10, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  Had tea with Sybil, who is just up, and who at last wants to give up having wounded Eng. Officers, for they spend their time getting drunk. She is tired of “doing her bit”</p>
		<p>   Geoffrey and I called on the Gregory Smiths and saw their fine flowers and then called at the Mariani’s to ask if Nikky was coming home, - found to our destiny that there was no chance of it. I am sorry, for it gives Marcella still a chance to spoil Geoffrey’s life for him.</p>
