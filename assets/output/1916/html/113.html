		<p>  Went over to the Braggiottis to hear Alice Garrett have a singing lesson. She has a good voice. Mme Braggiotti and her sister both sang – it was rather painful, such hideous voices. I fear Braggiotti’s system while it brings out the voice very well brings it out not sweet or delightful. Berry and I called on Aunt Janet, who came to dine, with Miss Hulton, who played. Bakst fell in love with her. </p>
