		<p>  Naima Löfroth, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  Got my table in working order, all the notes spread out around me. It is a sort of superior “Patience” and I thoroughly enjoy it. </p>
		<p>  Had an awful row with B.B. because I want to go home for Ray’s confinement. If I do, he will go to America, and I want anything but that. He is awfully selfish. Certainly I should let him go anywhere he liked for a month. It hurts awfully. He says he has put all his eggs in one basket (me) and alas he behaves so that they are added! I am really miserable. </p>
		<p>  Prince Paul came to call before going to Racconigi to visit the Queen and go with her to the Front. </p>
