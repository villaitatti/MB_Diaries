		<p>Tuesday, March 28, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Marcella Michela, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>  Glorious - </p>
		<p>  We lunched at Pratolino with Prince Paul and B.B. and I walked back from the grove. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey and Marcella Michela spent all the day together. I foresee a very great tangle and bothers. She will be very attaccata and he is sure to return to his natural position of under dog. I am really anxious. </p>
		<p>  BB thinks Geoffrey is lost for the moment, and will do nothing for himself or us till this fit is over. I fear it is true. </p>
