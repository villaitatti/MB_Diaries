		<p>Wednesday, February 16, 1916, 53 Rue de Varenne, Paris</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott also at Edith Wharton’s </p>
		<p>  Rain and shine</p>
		<p>  So lazy and tired! Dr. Ischwal came about my fibroid poisoning in the neck. He said he could cure me. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey and I went out to lunch with Ch. de Cossé. Mme Lydkyrck (?) was there, who was in Brussels at the time of the German occupation. They took possession of her chateau for a night, and left it full of ordures everywhere, carpets, chairs, beds… and they were officers!</p>
		<p>  Schlumberger came in, reporting hopeful conversations about French preparation and German demoralization. Such talk seems like echoes from centuries ago. </p>
