		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Rain and shine</p>
		<p>  Too rainy to do much, but towards evening Geoffrey and I walked on the hill below Acuto and enjoyed the beautiful plain. </p>
		<p>  I have lost interest in the matter of Marcella, so thrilling to him – it seems to me silly, now that I feel fairly sure it isn’t dangerous. She writes such empty rhetorical letters, and is altogether such a foolish young woman that I can’t go on talking about her. Naturally it is Geoffrey’s greatest adventure and he is bending all his energies to making it successful and staving off a tragic or ugly ending. But even so it’s rather foolish and wastes a lot of time. </p>
