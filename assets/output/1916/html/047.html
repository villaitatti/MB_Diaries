		<p>Wednesday, February 9, 1916, Ray’s, London</p>
		<p>   Horrible and useless struggles with the dressmakers in Durrants, said to be so very good, but failing so signally either to fit me or to give me honest material and sound work. It is my usual luck. </p>
		<p>  Went to Karin’s</p>
		<p>  Shopped, etc. </p>
		<p>  Ray and Oliver and I dined with the Amoses. </p>
		<p>  Morris talked very mechanically it seemed to me, as if his mind was just wound up. But he put immense gusto into it. </p>
		<p>  Emily and Alys and I lunched ah the Club and then, “for a spree,” Emily and I went to hear Alys speak (which she did very well) to a Hightgate Women’s Competition Society, on “Mothercraft.” </p>
		<p>  Tea at Karin’s, who appeared dirty and ragged, in a horrid confusion, but gay and amusing and winning. Adrian silent and snuffy as usual. </p>
