		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Eugénie Strong</p>
		<p>  Hot</p>
		<p>  Went to the furthest village beyond the Madonna del Sasso and walked back 1 ½ hours with Hutton to join the others at a picnic dinner, the others being Naima Eugénie and B.B.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey went down to see Marcella. Hutton told me he was desperately in love with Yoï, who – I should judge had become his mistress. He is ready to throw over everything for her - on the analogy of Paris who thought Helen worth burning Troy to the ground for. What a fool! But he is a dear little fellow. I quite love him for his (strange to say) Goodness. but he is a fool.</p>
