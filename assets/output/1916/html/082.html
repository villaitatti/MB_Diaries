		<p>Wednesday, March 15, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Teresa Hulton, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Called on Aunt Janet. B.B. and Sybil. </p>
		<p>  Teresa Hulton came to dine and stay, and Geoffrey came late. He had telegraphed that he would sleep in town, and I discreetly did not meet him, thinking Marcella probably was coming to see him. But he telephoned up at 9 and begged me to send. </p>
		<p>  He and Cecil saw over the huge Fiat works in Turin. </p>
