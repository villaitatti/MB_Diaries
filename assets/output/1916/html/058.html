		<p>Sunday, February 20, 1916, Paris</p>
		<p>  In bed</p>
		<p>  Mme de Coss√© called on me and dear Mrs. Cameron and Mrs. Royall Tyler - a snobbish, self-assertive, but very efficient lady. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey dined with them to meet Vollard. </p>

		<p>Monday, February 21, 1916, Paris</p>
		<p>  Feeling very ill, worse. </p>
		<p>  Weissmann came. He says I can leave on Saturday only. </p>
		<p>  I sent off his letter about Nikky which he read to me. Very wise and sincere but goodness I think it will be of no use at all when they meet. </p>
