		<p>Sunday, January 9, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Naima Löfroth</p>
		<p>Fine and very warm </p>
		<p>8 lunch, 6 dinner</p>
		<p>  Went on correcting B.B.’s dull and formless and slovenly articles. I hate it worse than anything; his writing is a real insult. They are much worse than his letters. But all clouds rolled away (not war cloud) by a glorious walk which he and I and Naima and Geoffrey took to Bagazzano, under a crystal clear sky, with a bracing wind. Geoffrey talked about M. all the way. It is some consolation in their many absences, for she is by no means free to go to see him even on her non-hospital days. The endless things he ….to say and I to listen. For it interests me, and I want him so to be happy. </p>
		<p>  Mr. and Mrs. Dumonts and Mr. Mitchell came to call. The latter is like a plump wax figure, inside and out. </p>
