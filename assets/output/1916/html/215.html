		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Cool</p>
		<p>  Went to town for dressmaking. </p>
		<p>  Hutton came over. We told him what we had said to Yoï, and he indignantly denied having said what I reputed, I am a great exaggerate, and may have read a lot into a remark no more explicit than “isn’t it marvelous that she shows no trace of having had 4 children”. </p>
		<p>  He seems candid, and I feel I must give him the benefit of the doubt Millet - though I remember his saying it - so I wrote to Yoï that I believed his denial. It doesn’t materially alter anything, for he said lots of things just as compromising. - “Would Nello kill her, do you think, if he knows?” etc. etc. </p>
		<p>  But he may be a rhetorical ass and let his tongue go. In which case it was a mistake of Geoffrey’s to try to convict her of having another lover. </p>
