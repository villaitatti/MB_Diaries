		<p>Friday, January 7, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia </p>
		<p>Misty but not bad</p>
		<p>4 <at> lunch, 3 <at> dinner </p>
		<p>  Shopped with Lina and the children for the Party. I hate all the fuss, yet do not feel it is an undesirable thing in itself. Young people rouse you.   </p>
		<p>  Had a long walk with Geoffrey, who is (of course) drifting in and in. He now has “absolute confidence in her purity and innocence and sincerity”- of course he may be right, but I cannot believe it of a girl grown to 26 in such surroundings, with such recklessness, so self-absorbed— and an Italian. It is fantastic. But it is useless to contradict him. I should only make him hate me, and probably accelerate the course of things by opposition. Besides, I may be wrong. I hope I am. But I see a very painful tragedy ahead. However, being a Cassandra is a poor trade, and youth faces many dangers without going under. Only Geoffrey has been so unlucky before, though full of beautiful dreams and confidence. I am very anxious. </p>
