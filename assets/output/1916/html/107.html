		<p>  We all went to the Gamberaia in the afternoon. </p>
		<p>  Richard Bagot and Mr. and Mrs. Price came to tea, and also Prince Paul. </p>
		<p>  Mme Luchaire to dine. She said one man had actually killed himself for Marcella and another, a Naval Officer, had attempted to do so, and had threatened it repeatedly.</p>
		<p>  Alys has begun to write again of Barbara – a great joy!</p>
		<p>  Mme Luchaire was rather full of Marcella’s monstrous lies. Marcella had come to her to ask her to tell certain lies to her friend Malvain, but Mme Luchaire refused and gave her a lecture on the awful way she lives, telling lies to everyone in order to save her face about her continuous tête-a-tête with young men.</p>
