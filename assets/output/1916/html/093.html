		<p> Sunday, April 2, Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Naima Löfroth</p>
		<p>  Glorious </p>
		<p>  Mrs. Kryal and Miss Flint (the dancing teacher) came to lunch. I was very sleepy. Geoffrey and Marcella went to the Laghetto from 4-8. It left him still amused and still cynical. She is famous for a hair, but vowed she never lied Geoffrey anyone “con cui stava.” Symptomatic remark. </p>
		<p>  B.B. and Naima and I had a glorious walk in the heights. It was really beautiful.</p>
		<p>  Bernard has begun to write “A appreciation of Leonardo’s paintings.” It may be very amusing. If only he wrote better it would be really delicious. </p>
