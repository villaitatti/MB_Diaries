		<p>Logan’s new Trivia</p>
		<p>  I know too much; I have stuffed too many of the facts of history and Astronomy into my intellectuals. My eyes have grown dim over looks; believing in Geological Periods and Cave Dwellers and Chinese Dynasties has prematurely aged me. </p>
		<p>  Why am I to blame for all that’s wrong in the world? I didn’t invent Sin and Hate and Slaughter. Who made it my business anyhow to administer the Universe and keep the stars to their Copernican Courses? My shoulders are bent beneath the weight of the firmament; I grow weary of propping up, like atlas, the vast and enormous Cosmos”</p>
