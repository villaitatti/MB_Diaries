		<p>  Geoffrey Scott </p>
		<p>  Glorious motor run to Arezzo no. 6 a lovely road. </p>
		<p>  Left Cecil there and came home by Reggello etc. also very lovely.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey growing rather cynical about Marcella Michela and her “high purposes” and low actions. It is the best way for him to treat what must be a non-permanent affair, a flirtation. It seems to amuse him and make him happy, although he is really too genuine a person to stand it very long. </p>
