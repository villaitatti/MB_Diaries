		<p>  Rain at last</p>
		<p>  Such a glorious rain! It lasted nearly 15 hours. Towards afternoon it cleaned up, and Hutton and I had our walk from the road to Monte Senario over to San Clemente. It was divinely beautiful, but we didn’t half enjoying it, we were talking so hard about Yoï. He is desperately in love, but doesn’t know what to do about it. He is like a fly, with its feet stuck on a Tanglefoot paper. She had told him about her affair with Geoffrey, but vowed it was all over. I said he had better talk to Geoffrey and learn the exact truth. He said if it hadn’t been for my warning he’d have run off with her already, throwing everything to the winds. I asked how he would have supported her. He had no idea, he’d have thought of that later. Poor little fool. But he is so sweet and good, I really like him.</p>
