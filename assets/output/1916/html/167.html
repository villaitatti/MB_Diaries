		<p>Thursday, July 6, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Nora Grifeo, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent </p>
		<p>  Hot</p>
		<p>  Motored out to the Mugello (Panicaglia near Borgo San Lorenzo), to see Princess Candriano (Noraâ€™s cousin) in the indescribably hideous little villino she has been building for herself in a lovely spot.</p>
		<p>  Ate our dinner on the pass by the stream. Lovely.</p>
		<p>  The English offensive makes my heart stunned still. All that murder and pain and wretchedness: How can men?</p>
		<p>  Prince Paul and the Placcis came to dine and Hutton. Placci was horrid.</p>
