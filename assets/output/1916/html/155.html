		<p>Sunday, June 25, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Nora Grifeo, Miss Stubbard, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>  We went to the Gamberaia, and Miss Hubbard and I left B.B. and Nora there, and I took her to Villa Medici. But she was thoroughly disgusted – jealous of Nora. I think, and perhaps ill, and it was uphill work. Poor thing, she is old and hideous and poor and she has arterial sclerosis. She’s never had a real chance. It is …fermenting in her, and makes her difficult.</p>
		<p>  Chatted in evening. Nora does all the talking. </p>
