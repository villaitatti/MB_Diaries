		<p>Saturday, January 5, 1916, Logan’s, London</p>
		<p>  Karin moved here, after 2 weeks exactly in nursing-home. She has had absolutely no complications. </p>
		<p>  The Thorolds and Miss Trelawney came to lunch at Aly’s. Theresa was especially delightful. I called on the Gibsons and then on Mary Crawshay. </p>
		<p>  As Oliver was spending the weekend at the Morrells and Ray in the New Forest with her sisters-in-law, Barbara and I came and stayed with Logan. </p>
		<p>  I took her to the MacCarthy’s. </p>
