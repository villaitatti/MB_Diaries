		<p>Sunday, June 18, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Naima LÃ¶froth</p>
		<p>  Fine </p>
		<p>  Worked on Leonardo manuscript. </p>
		<p>  Marcella came up to tea and walked over with Geoffrey to dine with Sybil. </p>
		<p>  She was looking terribly beautiful, with a softer expression than I have ever seen. Geoffrey reported her as very full of good sense and consideration, quite aware she must give him up to Nicky. I hope she has the character to work it out well. </p>
		<p>  BB and I walked over the Incontro - a most lovely walk.</p>
