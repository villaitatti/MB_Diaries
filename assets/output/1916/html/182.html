		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  84° in the day 78° all night!</p>
		<p>  Motored to Montesenario and lay in the pine woods discussing the “basis of ethics”.   Geoffrey stayed on there, while B.B. and I had glorious walk along a new path. We got back for dinner.</p>
		<p>  Yoï telephoned to know if she might come up some evening before we left (she wants to see Geoffrey), but I said we were engaged every evening. Geoffrey says he doesn’t care a bit what she thinks of him.</p>
