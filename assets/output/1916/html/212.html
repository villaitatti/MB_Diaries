		<p>Sunday, September 3, 1916, Vallombrosa</p>
		<p>  B.B. and Naima came up to lunch and we had a long walk. </p>
		<p>  It is too beautiful. Met the Buttles and Andersens.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey had a further talk with Yo√Ø, which he said was too horrible for words. She threatened to make it impossible for him to live in Italy. She said he had never met such malignity and baseness. </p>
