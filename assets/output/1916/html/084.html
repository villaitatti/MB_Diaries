		<p>Tuesday, March 21, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey woke up cured (he thinks!). Speriamo. But I donâ€™t for one instant think it. </p>
		<p>  We three walked round the top of Monte Ceceri, meeting dull Mr. Hulton on the way.     Called on Sybil and Geoffrey stayed to dine. </p>
		<p>  Mme. Henraux dined here. I got an impression of her being rather heavy and less spirituelle than I had thought. </p>
