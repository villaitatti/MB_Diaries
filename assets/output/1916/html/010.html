		<p>Tuesday, January 4, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p> Julia</p>
		<p>Glorious day, very warm</p>
		<p>4 <at> lunch, 3 <at> dinner </p>
		<p>  De Nicola came to see B.B. Geoffrey and I had a morning walk in the laghetto, an exceptional affair, because of the exceptional day. </p>
		<p>  De Nicola stayed to lunch. He was at the Front at Plava,but lacked all power to tell about anything. </p>
		<p>  I motored him down and Geoffrey. We picked up Marcella Michela and I took them towards Bagni a Ripoli and started them on a walk — much better for them there stuffing indoors. She looked very beautiful and I felt drawn to her. I think if I were in Geoffrey’s place my head would be turned, but he seems to keep his balance miraculously. Long may it last. </p>
		<p>  Called on Yoï where I met her sister and Byba. </p>
		<p>  Picked up Julia and Gordon at Villa Medici. </p>
		<p>  B.B and I alone </p>
