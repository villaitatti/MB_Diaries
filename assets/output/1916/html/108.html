		<p>Thursday, April 27, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Gaetano Salvemini </p>
		<p>  Divine</p>
		<p>  Walked with B.B. and Salvemini. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey went down to receive Marcella who had been spending the afternoon with “Mattia”. What a silly girl, acting on the barest sex impulses and talking such long-aided talk about the linea estetica of her inner life, etc. I am getting rather bored with her, though Geoffrey lives on it. </p>
		<p>  Ferrando and his tragic lady-love and their Belgian guest, and young painter named Jeanne, came to dine. </p>
