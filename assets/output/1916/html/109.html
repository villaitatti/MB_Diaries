		<p> Sunday, April 30, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Naima LÃ¶froth, Geoffrey Scott </p>
		<p>  Fine </p>
		<p>  We walked to the Madonna del Sasso, B.B. Naima and I, and at the bottom of the road we met by the Marchesa Guadagni and her 4 boys, and brought in. They were too curious about it to bear it any longer. She is a handsome, vigorous original woman, of a truly English type, frank-talking, indiscreet overbearing, eccentric, but nice. Her husband seems a cretin. </p>
		<p>  We took her boy back to Florence in the car, a great giant of 17. </p>
		<p>  The walk was glorious.</p>
