		<p>Friday, June 30, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Nora Grifeo, Guido Cagnola</p>
		<p>  Went to the Madonna del Sasso with Lina and Mr. Hutton and Geoffrey and Yoï, while Guido Cagnola (who unexpectedly appeared) and Nora and BB came with Sybil. </p>
		<p>  Lina and Hutton and I had a god walk first, to the top, which us thoroughly enjoyed. Geoffrey and Yoï sat talking chastely over past joy which neither is in the mood for renewing. </p>
		<p>  The Salveminis came to lunch, married at last.</p>
		<p>  B.B. received an anonymous letter saying Marcella was Geoffrey’s mistress.</p>
		<p>A message from Marcella was waiting for Geoffrey that she couldn’t go on their expedition tomorrow, and he mustn’t telephone. He feels into a fearful state of jealousy, as he knew Malvano was back, and telephoned at once, but she was out. He was like a semi crazy person all night. Yet he says the affair is as “as dead as mutton”</p>
