		<p>Monday, January 10, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Glorious. Warm: </p>
		<p>4 lunch, 4 dinner </p>
		<p>  Such a day! A marvel of marvels. But I couldn’t employ it well, as I had engagements. </p>
		<p>  I took Lina and Gordon and Julia to the Pitti — what a poor lot of pictures with a few gems — the Granduca, the Dama Velata, the Aretino and the “Young Englishman” and parts of the Concert and of the Rubens. Goodness how one changes! </p>
		<p>  We called on Sir Thomas Dich Lauder (out) and Lady Enniskillen who talked a lot of gossip. </p>
		<p>  Tea’d, shopped, and picked up Geoffrey, who had had a visit from Marcella Michela</p>
		<p>  Cook difficulties, as usual, since that devil Aristea left. </p>
		<p>  Long talk with Geoffrey. Such things are endless </p>
