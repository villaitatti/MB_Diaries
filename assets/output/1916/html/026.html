		<p>[Thursday, January 20] </p>
		<p>  Julia, Geoffey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>  Bought Julia’s photos. Got passports etc. for all the children. </p>
		<p>  Yoï came to lunch. She seems old and dispirited and has no more joy in her. Her mother in-law has been here for months, and has been too much for her. She didn’t even flirt with Geoffrey! </p>
		<p>  Salvemini, Mme Luchaire and Sybil came to dine. </p>
