		<p>Sunday, July 2, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Nora Grifeo</p>
		<p>  Drove up and walked back behind Morgans’. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey agitatedly waiting all day for the phone message, which didn’t come till late, as Marcella went to sleep after one all night at the hospital. He is in a rotten state.</p>
		<p>  Lady and Miss Methuen, Sybil, French and the boys came to dine, Mr. and Mrs. Hulton afterward.</p>
		<p>  Nora has begun to pour her woes into Geoffrey’s ear, as B.B. and I aren’t sympathetic enough. </p>
