		<p>Wednesday, January 5, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Misty</p>
		<p>3 <at> lunch, <at> 9 dinner </p>
		<p>  The boys gave a children’s party to which also Naima and Lina went, but I didn’t. I had a walk alone, trying to compose my mind and soul, and B.B. had a walk with Sybil. If one’s feelings could only harmonize with one’s judgment.</p>
		<p>  Capt. Perry came to tea, and Mr. and Mrs. Trench, Mr. Dumonts, the boys, and Lina to dinner. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey stayed and talked and talked till nearly 2. Perhaps it helps him to see clearly, but that does have so little influence on actions and feelings!</p>
