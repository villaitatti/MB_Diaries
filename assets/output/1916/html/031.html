		<p>Tuesday, January 25, 1916, Ray’s London</p>
		<p>  Hours on the quai at Southampton and reached London only at 4 o’clock. Came straight to Aly’s.</p>
		<p>  Went on to see Karin and her little baby whom Adrian wants to name AN (!) </p>
		<p>  Karin had the folly to take only one room in the place she found for herself (I had a lovely nursing-home ready for her, so she is disturbed by the nurse and baby. But as she is perfectly well, it doesn’t so much matter. </p>
		<p>  Came out to Barbara’s bath “It’s Granma Mary!” she shouted – and then she said “Two Granmas, Granma Mary and Gramma Auntilu (to Aly’s grand delight). She turned somersaults and swam “like a mermaid” in her bath, and was heavenly, and adorable. </p>
