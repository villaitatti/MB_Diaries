		<p>NOTE </p>
		<p>Trivia</p>
		<p> Misgiving </p>
		<p>  We were talking of people, and a name familiar to us all was mentioned. We paused and looked at each other; then soon by means of anecdotes and clever touches, that personality was reconstructed in our conversation. It seemed to appear before us, large, pink and life-like, and gives a comic sketch of itself with appropriate poses. </p>
		<p>  “Of course”, I said to myself, “this sort of thing never happens to me”. For the notion was quite unthinkable, the notion I mean of my own image, so clear to me and strange and sacred, caught like this defenceless in a net of talked, and called up to turn my discreet way of life into a cake walk. </p>
		<p>YOUTH.</p>
		<p>O dear, this living and eating and growing old; there doubts and aches in the back, and want of interest in stars and roses….</p>
		<p>  Am I the person who used to make in the middle of the night and laugh with the joy of living? Who worried about the existence of God, and danced with young ladies till long after day break? Who sang “Auld Lang Syne” and howled with sentiment, and more than once gazed at the summer stars through a blur of great, romantic tears. </p>
