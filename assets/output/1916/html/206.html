		<p>Tuesday, August 29, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Hot!</p>
		<p>  B.B. fit to be in bed. He feels horribly seasick. It is 84° and very trying. </p>
		<p>  B.B. went up to Monte Senario, but it did him no good. </p>
		<p>  I went to see Aunt Janet who talked a lot about Hutton and Yoï. She has it greatly on her mind. I tried to make her think there was nothing in it. </p>
