		<p>Friday, August 18, 1916, Hotel Appennino, Pian della Gotta, Garfagnana</p>
		<p>  Lina motoring </p>
		<p>  Fine and then storm</p>
		<p>  Started about 11, having hung sound an extra half hour on the chance of Geoffrey receiving the longed-for letter.</p>
		<p>  Motored from Massa to Carrara - Fosdinovo - Fivizzano, where we had an excellent lunch. Then to Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, where the bibliotecario was away, of course! </p>
		<p>  Then up the Pass towards Pieve Pelago, taking tea in the chestnut woods. </p>
		<p>  Arriving at Pian della Gottta we could get beds only in the house of the arciprete, but these were clean and nice. We heard him moving overhead - he was putting biscuit tins in crucial spots to prevent the rain coming through onto the beds. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey is very glad he came, as it distracts him from worrying. </p>
