		<p>Saturday, May 6, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Sarnes</p>
		<p>  Fair </p>
		<p>  Went to Uffizi with the party. Alice Garrett is almost too stupid. But she is nice too. </p>
		<p>  Yoï and Nello came up to lunch, and we had a great show of Alice’s dresses afterwards. She has some pretty ones. Bakst superintended and gave interesting criticisms.</p>
		<p>  The Actons, Lady Enniskillen, Countess d’Ossay, Countess Robilant and the Marchese Antinori came to tea. Quite meaningless. </p>
		<p>  We had a dull dinner at Sybil, but Miss de Roebeck played splendidly, and also Teresa, with whom Bakst fell more in love. He wants to paint her. </p>
