		<p>Thursday, January 6, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia </p>
		<p>Misty turning to fine </p>
		<p>5 <at> lunch, 3 <at> dinner </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey decided to take things lightly in spite of the earnest and soulful vocabulary. He is certainly happier and more contented. Before this came he found living in Florence rather stale. He had Marcella Michela to tea. </p>
		<p>  Julia and Maeve Trench and Gordon played in the Laghetto, while B.B and Lina and I had a splendid walk on the hill. Signora Bozzelli and her sweet little daughter Miriam were here when we came back, and later her lover, Guido Ferrando, came in. She is intense and inexpressive. </p>
		<p>  B.B wrote an article on a picture in Detroit by Giovanni Paolo di Agostini. Rather dull, needs rewriting. </p>
