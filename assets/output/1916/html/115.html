		<p>Tuesday, May 9, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Mrs. Garrett, Léon Bakst, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Teresa sat again to Bakst. </p>
		<p>  In the afternoon I took them to tea at the Actons, first doing a little shopping in town, gorgeous stuff for Alice Garrett’s dressing gowns. </p>
		<p>  In the evening Paul came to dine and Teresa after. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey and Marcella had a walk. She was terribly upset because someone had written an anonymous letter to her friend Malvano saying she and Geoffrey were lovers. She might have expected it, considering she sees him constantly for long hours alone at his house, and never receive him at hers, and lies of a clumsy sort to hide her doings. But it is certainly her other “friend” Mattia Vasconcelos who has done it, thinking to kill two rivals with one stone. She was fearfully indignant that “anyone could think such a thing” - !!</p>
		<p>  That is the limit of folly. But she is really a goose. </p>
