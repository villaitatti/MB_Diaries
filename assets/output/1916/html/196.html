		<p>Saturday, August 19, 1916, Hotel Radio, Equi</p>
		<p>  Motoring with Geoffrey Scott and Lina Waterfield</p>
		<p>  Storm and fine</p>
		<p>  Motored over the pass back from Pian della Gotta and had a ** most glorious view of the Apuan mountains. </p>
		<p>  Saw the little XVIII century Library (archivio) at Castelnuovo di Garfagnana, and went up into the heart of the Monte Pisanino to a little place called Vagli Superiore, where we lunched. </p>
		<p>  Reached Equi for tea, and explored the cavern and the cave full of the bones of prehistoric men and animals. </p>
		<p>  Lina has observed poor little Hutton’s passion for Yoï, and she talked to me about it. I said I thought Yoï wouldn’t upset everybody’s applecart for him. Lina was awfully concerned and distressed.</p>
