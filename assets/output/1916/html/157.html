		<p>Tuesday, June 27, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Nora Grifeo</p>
		<p>  Took Nora down, while B.B. called on Sybil. She called on a friend, and I on Flora Priestley and Yoï, the latter in bed out with Fosco’s illness and naughtiness. He spits on her and scratches her, and yells to annoy her, and is fearfully jealous of the nurse into the younger brother – a bad beginning.</p>
		<p>  Nora talked in the evening, chiefly about the Duchessa d’Aosta. </p>
		<p>  I carried Geoffrey up the hill on my way to Flora’s, and he got out to see Lady Enninskillen. He said the Marcella Michela affair seemed like a thing lived through for years and years and now subsisting on fonder memories, with no hope a excitement left. </p>
