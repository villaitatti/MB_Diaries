		<p>Monday, February 7, 1916, Loganâ€™s, London, with Barbara</p>
		<p>  Went with Logan to Chilling and found Alys there since 2 days doing what she could to hurry on the dilatory workers who had promised to have everything ready to put the furniture in place. </p>
		<p>  It was very lovely there, with Constable effects of sky are the meadows and Sound. A really heavenly spot. </p>
