		<p>Sunday, August 20, 1916, Massa</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  We went up to the end of the road to see the cliffs and the awful peak Aubrey climbed. </p>
		<p>  Got to Aulla at 11 and while Lina saw her friends, Geoffrey and I motored to Bagnone, talking of course chiefly about Marcella Michela</p>
		<p>  Came back by Sarzana, where we saw the Cathedral. </p>
		<p>  My cold is getting well at last. </p>
		<p>  Came over Fosdinovo - Carrara Pass on which we met B.B. and Sybil in her car. </p>
		<p>  Stopped at Fosdinovo and saw the churches and chatted with the Priest, whose nurse was full of profughi from the earthquake at Pesaro. One woman still looked awfully scared. </p>
