		<p>Saturday, January 8, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Naima Löfroth, Iris Cutting, Gordon Waterfield</p>
		<p>4 lunch 8 dinner </p>
		<p>  We had a children’s party consisting of Julia, Iris Cutting, Gordon Waterfield, Gigliola and Renzo Giglioli, 2 Brawley, Maeve Trench, Paquita Rogermeyer, 4 Casarti and Pallavicinis, Elvyth Arbuthnot, 2 Actons, and various grown-ups, who formed the heavy and difficult part. However it went off very well. Iris and Gordon spent the night. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey and I went down to the opera “Norma,” with Marcella and her rather sad and faded looking mother (a Fabbricotti) and Byba. The 2 girls looked very beautiful and very “foreign.” It was like a page out of a novel by Ouida. Marcella is certainly very beautiful, vivid, brilliant, and vital. I have seldom seen (outside of Gladys) a girl with more promise. But her eyes are hard, and she looks like a bird of prey — a beautiful one, but frightening — Very selfwilled and self-absorbed, but awfully interesting. Geoffrey may think himself lucky, unless he gets really in love. </p>
