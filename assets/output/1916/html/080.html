		<p>Monday, March 13, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Rain, sun Rainstorm </p>
		<p>  Today BB and I had a walk, and then the Countess Serristori came. We all cried at the thought of the war. We could talk about it, it was a strain. </p>
		<p>  BB dined with Sybil. He had a letter from Belle Greene, who wants to come to Italy, but BB doesnâ€™t want her to on account of Sybil!! </p>
