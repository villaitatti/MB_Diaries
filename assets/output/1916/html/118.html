		<p>Friday, May 12, 1916, Palace Hotel, Perugia</p>
		<p>  We left after lunch and motored here. It is a wretched hotel compared to the old Bonfani, which is now closed on account of the War. </p>
		<p>  We came a new road, over the hills from Cortona to La Magione, though a pass ablaze with golden broom. </p>
		<p>  This was May 16. </p>
