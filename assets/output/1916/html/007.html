		<p>1916</p>
		<p>Mary Whitall Berenson</p>
		<p>I Tatti</p>
		<p>Settignano</p>
		<p>Italy. Florence</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Saturday, January 1, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Naima Löfroth, Cecil Pinsent </p>
		<p>6 <at> lunch, 6 <at> dinner</p>
		<p>  Wasted a good deal of time (if it is waste) walking with Geoffrey. I hope it clears his mind and fortifies him: but I see him doomed to great unhappiness in the affair in which he is embarked. However, probably even Something with an unhappy ending is better than Nothing, for the Young.   </p>
		<p>  We went with Lina and Gordon and Julia to the Actons’ children’s party - a badly managed affair with too many vulgar flirting Florentines at it, crowding out the children.  </p>
		<p>  Walter Dowdeswell came to dine and was very clownish and amusing, telling ghost stories and reciting comic poems. </p>
