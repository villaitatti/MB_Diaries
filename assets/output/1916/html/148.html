		<p>  Fine </p>
		<p>  We are doing the proofs for BB’s book on Venetian Paintings in U.S.A.</p>
		<p>  BB drove up to Monte Senario with Sybil and found it very cold. I think he got a chill.   Geoffrey and I walked on the place and discussed “new (?) aspects of the eternal topic. </p>
		<p>  He dined with Sybil, and I had Lina and Mrs. Krayl and Edward Hutton to dine, and took them to see the Gamberaia by moonlight. Stan Krayl asked me to know her up to see Cecil several times” before he left for the Italian Front (July 1), but I had to refuse, as he wouldn’t stay on last night to see her, and I know he doesn’t want to. </p>
		<p>  B.B. says Sybil is “carrying on” about Nora Grifeo’s visit here, tears and reproaches and constant nagging. How silly of her. It’s the very worst way to handle him. Or any man.</p>
