		<p>Wednesday, July 5, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>   Geoffrey Scott, Nora Grifeo, Cecil Pinsent </p>
		<p>  Went out to the Pass to the Mugello and Hutton and I got out and had a 2 hours walk joining the others at that divine spot, Candigliana, where we had dinner. </p>
		<p>  The others were Geoffrey and Yoï, who came with us, and spent their time agreeably philandering (Yoï is a sotter!), and both Sybil and Iris who came later.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey seems safe, and this is distraction from that peril, Marcella.</p>
		<p>  Sybil had been for a midnight ride till 2 in Trench’s ‘puffer,’ and was consequently very ill. She has no judgment about things she can safely do with her delicate health. </p>
