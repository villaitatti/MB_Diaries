		<p>Monday, August 21, 1916, Marina di Massa</p>
		<p>  Bathed twice.</p>
		<p>  The Salveminis came to dinner. </p>
		<p>  We explored Bocca di Magra, a most lovely little fishing village, dominated by the Fabbricotti palaces - awful erections. What a divine country this is!</p>
		<p>  Letter at last from Marcella Michela which, although it says nothing explicit, relieves Geoffreyâ€™s mind a lot. Most of it was - about two other men who are at her mountain resort!! What an impossible creature.</p>
