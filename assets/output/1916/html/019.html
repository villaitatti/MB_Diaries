		<p>Thursday, January 13, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Cold rain </p>
		<p>4 lunch, 4 dinner </p>
		<p>  Miss Grace Hubbard to lunch, an earnest person, seeking to be fair and honest in her thoughts and views. We all liked her. </p>
		<p>  Called on Loesers with Mrs. Dumonts and Geoffrey, B.B and Sybil. </p>
		<p>  Salvermini and Mme Luchaire to dine. Talked of the ideal api-cultural Italy, which no one wants. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey dined at Sybil who held long discorsi to prove that B.B was quite wrong in saying she was “self-absorbed” </p>
