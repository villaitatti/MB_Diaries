		<p>Wednesday, March 22, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Took Mrs. Ross and Lina to lunch with the Dowdeswells. Ghastly. </p>
		<p>  Called on Mr. Dumont. </p>
		<p>  Walked with BB, who dined with Sybil. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey came very late from one of those earth shaking interviews with Marcella which change everything and put things on an entirely new footing </p>
		<p>- au fond, changing nothing, but precipitating in down the inevitable path</p>
		<p>-meanwhile, and by the way, making you an impossible member of ordinary society.</p>
