		<p>Sunday, August 5, Villa Bice, Massa di Marina [sic]</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Sybil Cutting, Iris, ourselves</p>
		<p>  Started at 7.30 and got here in the car at 12. </p>
		<p>  Found Sybil on the beach - and our lazy life began. All morning in bathing and perhaps bathing again! </p>
		<p>  Sybil is wonderfully better.</p>
		<p>  I fear Iâ€™ve caught a cold.</p>
