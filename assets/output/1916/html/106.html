		<p>Wednesday, April 19, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Grey cold</p>
		<p>  B.B. and I had a long delightful walk in the woods, as he wants to dine with Sybil and there had per miracolo an afternoon free.</p>
		<p>  Alys wired that she had got safely to England, not being torpedoed on the Atlantic, and that Barbara was “enchanting”. That I will believe, and I loved to read it.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey received Marcella for one of her determined and lengthy tête-a-tête, but she was nicer this time, and I read Italian poetry with him, and was intelligent and __, instead of spending all her time spooning. He liked it better, for his method of lovemaking is like the Snark’s method of Charity: “She collects but she does not subscribe”. </p>
		<p>  He came back very pleased. But I can see that both of them are heading for a stormy “affair” all the same, I hope it will keep off till I go to America, for I don’t like the young woman, and I feel sure she will make Geoffrey unhappy. But perhaps even unhappiness is better than ‘nothing doing.’</p>
