		<p>  Geoffrey Scott </p>
		<p>  We went in to see Horne, who is much worse. He held Bernard’s hand and said he had been for days trying to recall the saying “the falling out of faithful friends is love’s renewing”. He begged Bernard to go on being friends with him, and when Bernard said he would, he said “this is a moment of real happiness for me”. </p>
		<p>  Marcella spent the afternoon with Geoffrey </p>
