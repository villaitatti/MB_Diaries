		<p>Monday, June 5, 1916, Grand Hotel, Rome</p>
		<p>  Went to Anagni, but B.B. was so raging with the little boys that had the keys (they were pests!) that I wouldn’t stay – it first choked me. I am getting so that I really cannot put up with exhibitions of temper. I mean to do always as I did this morning, - quietly go away. </p>
		<p>  I walked back along the road about 4 kilometers before they overtook me. I missed seeing the treasure.</p>
		<p>  In the afternoon we motored to Rome, via Genazzano, Cantorano, Tivoli, and Marcellino, a divine road – getting here at 9. </p>
