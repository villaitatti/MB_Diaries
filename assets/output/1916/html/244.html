		<p>Wednesday, October 4, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Glorious</p>
		<p>  Fearful day of indecision about going home. B.B. is so against it, so afraid, somehow of being left alone, and so far from well, that I gave in and said I would not go, if he felt he really couldn’t spare me. </p>
		<p>  But there must be something he doesn’t say, some “complex” about having given up Belle Greene, and wanting me to give up as much - or something I don’t understand to account for the violence on his expressions.</p>
		<p>  I am utterly worn out with it. </p>
		<p>  We took THE walk and found it very beautiful. He seemed to get happy when I said I would not go if he felt so strongly about it. </p>
		<p>  But it does seem to using my heart most horribly. </p>
