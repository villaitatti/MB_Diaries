		<p>Friday, February 1, 1916, Ray’s, London</p>
		<p>Last furious fight at dressmakers’. The jacket was so awful that they saw it would not do, although they “couldn’t understand it - such a thing had never happened before.”</p>
		<p>  Alys had a farewell tea, but I felt very ill and had to go to a Dr. (MacNaughton 33 upper Belgrave St.) who syringed my ear and gave me things for my neck and shoulder. </p>
		<p>  I saw however Jo Robinson and Louise Kinsella and the Whitalls. Barbara (the angel) was there. </p>
		<p>  Emily and Ray and I dined, and A. had the inspiration of giving us some warmed-over mutton (horrible) as her farewell feast. The food is the worst any of us encountered anywhere. She is too economical. </p>
		<p>  Called on Lawsons, who, as usual, are at their last penny. She gets £__ a week as head of </p>
		<p>the Nurses’ hostel. </p>
