		<p>Tuesday, January 11, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Glorious cooler</p>
		<p>3 lunch, 3 dinner </p>
		<p>  Dismissed the cook. What a bore. </p>
		<p>  B.B drove and walked with Sybil. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey and I motored to Terzano, behind Bagno a Ripoli, and then walked over the Incontro to Villamagna. It was absolutely DIVINE. For the first time since it began, I think, I forgot about the war for several hours on end. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey on the unending theme, but he is always subtle, amusing, kind and profound. He really isn’t much in love, though she’s awfully nice. Curious how these things go. </p>
		<p>  Left him at Byba’s, and he dined at Sybil’s, where I called to pick up B.B and say goodbye to Lady Limerick and Capt. Perry. </p>
