		<p>Thursday, June,1, 1916, Naples to Fiuggi</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Rain and shine</p>
		<p>  We left Naples at 9.30 and saw Capua – that fine “Easter Candle” in the Duomo, and the glorious Head of Capua that once adorned Frederick the Great’s Arch. It is more beautiful than the head at Ravello. </p>
		<p>  We saw Teano, too, but it scarcely repaid, except for the lovely country it is in. </p>
		<p>  We lunched on the hills, and then saw over Monte Cassino, with its sumptuous courts and terraces, and arrived here (*Albergo della Fonte) at 7.45</p>
