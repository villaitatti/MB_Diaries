		<p>Saturday, February 12, 1916, Ray’s, London</p>
		<p>  Alys went off at 8:35 from Euston. She is going to N.Y. second class on a second-class steamer! </p>
		<p>  Eliza and I had a last row at the dressmaker’s over the bluse which cost £2.2 and is so badly made that I can hardly wear it. </p>
		<p>  Lunched with Karin and said goodbye. </p>
		<p>  Called on Mrs. Strong. </p>
		<p>  Went with Ray to see her Exhibition of Vanessa’s pictures, quite horrible. </p>
		<p>  The MacLagans were there, full of disgust. </p>
