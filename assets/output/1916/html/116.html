		<p>Wednesday, May 10, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  They went just after lunch. B.B. having taken Alice to the Pitti and ‘thaught her to see with his eyes.’ </p>
		<p>  Bakst finished a second sketch of Teresa before going. </p>
		<p>  A Mr. George Plaisted, Harvard Institute scholar came. awful accent, seemed not like a gentleman, but intelligent and rather nice. Would love to go and fight the Germans. </p>
		<p>  Took Geoffrey, Teresa and her mother to call on Mrs. Mitchell and see his roses. I liked him a little. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey went to the theatre with Teresa and the Sfornis to see Ibsen’s Doll’s House, which we used to thrill over 31 years ago, Mary Nimis, A__ Shaw, the Webbs, the Cobden Sandersons and all of us. It is a good acting play still but the theme seemed vieux jeu. </p>
		<p>  The Dumonts dined here.</p>
		<p>  I went for Plaisted about his accent. </p>
