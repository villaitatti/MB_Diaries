		<p>  Magda had been for 10 months running a hospital in Belgium.</p>
		<p>  She was most interesting. Trench was a bore. </p>
		<p>  She had seen a woman crucified at a door with her breasts cut off, a child with both hands clipped off, another child transfixed to a barn-door with huge knife, and a mother with a child dead in her arms, shot by the commanding officer (German) as his answer to spare her husband for the sake of the 4 children – “there will be only 3 now”. The woman was crazy and no one could get the child out of her arms. </p>
