		<p>  Talked with Bernard. He cares a lot about Miss Greene but would give her up if I made a row. I donâ€™t like though to cut off a thing (however silly it seems to me) that may be vital to him. It is difficult, for I do detest the whole business. But if it makes Bernard feel alive and keeps him interested, I suppose I have no right to cut it off especially having let him go into it. </p>
		<p>  Called on Aunt Janet, who suddenly looks very old. </p>
		<p>  Prince Paul and Placci came to dine. The turkey was very tough! </p>
