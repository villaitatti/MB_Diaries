		<p>Sunday, February 13, 1916, Logan’s, London</p>
		<p>  Quiet day with Ray and Barbara but I feel very ill. </p>
		<p>  The Huttons came with their little boy, Peter, whose powers in drawing and arranging soldiers greatly excited Barbara. Saw her in her bath - it was awful leaving her, but fortunately she scarcely took it in, and is so busy in her child’s life anyhow not that she doesn’t care. </p>
		<p>  Ray and Oliver have been perfectly delightful. </p>
		<p>  Roger Fry dined with me and Logan. He is always interesting, but has no judgment. He thinks Vanessa’s pictures are superb. She, by the way, has thrown him over and taken Duncan Grant as her lover, the first woman he ever took notice of. Her husband, Clive Bell, is making love to a cousin of Oliver’s, Mrs. Hutchinson, they are a queer lot. </p>
