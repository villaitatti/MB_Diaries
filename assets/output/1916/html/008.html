		<p>Sunday, January 2, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia, Naima <LÃ¶froth> Cecil <Pinsent></p>
		<p>Muggy</p>
		<p>6   <at> lunch, 5 <at> dinner </p>
		<p>  I went down to see Miss Priestly at her hospital. I saw a man whose jaw and tongue had been shot off, and others who have lost limbs, especially from frost-bite. I took there some Fels Naptha soap, the best cleaning soap there is.</p>
		<p>  Then I called for Miss Cochrane and brought her up to lunch. She has some sort of spiritistic crank at the back up her head, the old goose. I took her to Mrs. Ross. </p>
		<p>  B.B and Naima took a walk and Geoffrey spent the day with M.M., who seems a nicer person than she did at first. </p>
		<p>  Julia had a day in bed, as it was her first monthly time, poor child. </p>
