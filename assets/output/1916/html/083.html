		<p>Monday, March 20, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott </p>
		<p>  Grey</p>
		<p>  Ray telegraphed that her operation is postponed. Though she will have another baby without it. Her perfect nurse-housekeeper, Florence, is leaving her, on account of ill-health. Geoffrey still very much â€¦ though he tries to pretend he is not. I foresee great trouble for him unless he recovers.</p>
		<p>  Miss Flint, a teacher of dancing, and Mrs. Krayl called. </p>
		<p>  Miss Hulton and her young male Gino Villari dined here. She played, and the music upset Geoffrey as it always does people in love.</p>
