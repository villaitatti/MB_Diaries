		<p>Friday, January 14, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Glorious. Warm   </p>
		<p>Julia, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>   </p>
		<p>4 lunch, 5 dinner </p>
		<p>  Prepared villino for Geoffrey’s pass: the scarlet fever. Lina came along and Gordon climbed on the roof with Julia. </p>
		<p>  Had a long and glorious walk with B.B. over the scavi to the very top and back by Fiesole. He went to see Sybil and I was picked up by Lady Enniskillen who brought me home. Sybil was still going on about not being self-absorbed, her very tenacity and volubility proving she was!</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey had a walk with Byba, who came in to tea and discussed common acquaintances.     He had a letter from Marcella Michela and … use! </p>
