		<p>Tuesday, April 12, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  Took a Blue Nun down to Horne, who is worse. He seemed grateful. I told him he must make a will to leave Santina an annuity of 50 francs a month for the rest of her life. He said he would, and then he sent for Poggi (head of the Uffizi) and an avvocato. </p>
		<p>  When I went back in the afternoon, they came with the draft will, leaving his Palace and its contents to the State, and I made them put in the pension for Santina. I was just in time, as he is worse and a little wandering, and without me he would have probably died intestate. </p>
		<p>  He asked for B.B. and was much touched when I gave him a message of affection. He said that it had all been a mistake, and that now he thought it all very foolish to quarrel over attributions or successes. “I wanted my own success” he said “and my bit of pocket-money”.     His conscience seems uneasy, and indeed I know that BB and I have absolutely nothing to reproach ourselves with.</p>
