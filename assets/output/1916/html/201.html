		<p>Thursday, August 24, 1916, Marina di Massa</p>
		<p>  Scirocco</p>
		<p>  Took Iris to Viareggio to see Dr. Simonetti for her acne. </p>
		<p>  “Took out” little Evaide Giannini from the Institute di San Dorotea and had her photo taken, gave her an ice at her caffé and chocolate to take to the other girls in her class, and took her a ride in the automobile. She returned in her school a very happy little girl.</p>
		<p>  B.B. called on Mme Salvemini and her parents, the Dauriacs, whom he liked, and also Mme Orilies.</p>
		<p>  Bathed twice</p>
		<p>  Sybil gets worse and worse. Decidedly we weren’t meant to see much of each other. She is pathologically self-absorbed and indifferent to and unobservant of the feelings of others. I understand how her husband must have felt.</p>
