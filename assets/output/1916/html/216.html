		<p>  I went down to the Counsul’s and found that there are many difficulties in the way of travel. </p>
		<p>  After our awful struggle we decided not to go to America, but to remain here till the end of the war. </p>
		<p>  I don’t see how I can bear not to go to England: It is awful for me. But I am tremendously relieved about America. To go and amuse ourselves with fashionable life there in war-time would have been intolerable. </p>
