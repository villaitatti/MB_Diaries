		<p>  Naima Löfroth, Marcella Michela</p>
		<p>  Marcella “performed” very brilliantly for me alone in the morning, telling about her brother-in-law’s experiences as commander of an Italian sub-marine. </p>
		<p>  She also performed at lunch for the benefit of Dr. Crescenzi, whom I invited to get as a husband for Naima, who is so convinced by my argument against her lonely life that she would like to marry him. Her intentions being strictly honorable, she is afraid to seem forward and ask him to come and see her. So I sent him some Hospital supplies (from America), and on the strength of it invited him to come up. A really nice man, good and clever and strong. She would be lucky. He took him to call on Mrs. Ross later. </p>
		<p>  Marcella had her young Roman sailor friend, Capitano Tuttino, who spent the afternoon with her, the one she wrote so blandly to Geoffrey about as being like a nice younger brother. He is 28 and is clearly in love with her and if [082] she doesn’t know if she is stupid. They walked together while BB and I entertained Frizzoni. When the latter and the Capitano went down in the motor, BB and I were so tired we just crept off by ourselves. </p>
		<p>  In the evening, Marcella, tired too, perhaps, was more like a human being, and BB liked her very much. I quite loved her, though I still feel something very strange about her, and especially about her relations with men. Then she dyes her hair, which is very strange for a young girl, and her eyes are hard and glittering. But there’s something else simple and good and very noble in her.</p>
