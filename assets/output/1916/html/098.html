		<p>  Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott, Naima Löfroth</p>
		<p>  Grey then fine</p>
		<p>  Dr. Crescenzi came to lunch and he and Naima and B.B. and I had a walk on the down from S. Clemente: divine. </p>
		<p>  There seems no chance of it, but I wish Naima might catch him. She wants to, and he is a very nice, good man. </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey feels rather flat and foolish, having preached so much, yet encouraging Marcella to continue seeing him in secret and lying about it, it on the ground that it is a noble and fine relation, whim he suspects is just like the others, but with more sex intensity. It is all rather foolish, though human. </p>
