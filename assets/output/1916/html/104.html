		<p>Saturday, April 15, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Naima Löfroth, Miss Hulton</p>
		<p>  Fine cold</p>
		<p>  B.B. and I, with Herbert Trench went to Horne’s funeral at the Protestant Cemetery.</p>
		<p>L’assistance was composed of “Sods” and dealers, very typical of one side of the poor fellow’s life. </p>
		<p>  Trench was full of a new “great” poem he had just composed, and Loeser was heard to say “when I marry again, I shall marry a deaf-mute”. </p>
		<p>  No one wept, no one cared as much as I did. I think, unless it was that unspeakable little mini Collingwood Gee. It seemed rather tragic, but at least he is no longer suffering.  </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey took Miss Hulton a walk in the Laghetto. </p>
		<p>  The Marainis and Prince Paul joined on party of 6 at dinner. Nello was furiously jealousy, and Yoï whispered to Geoffrey that he had made her an awful scene. </p>
		<p>  Undercurrents run strong, but were dissipated by music. Teresa plays beautifully, and she is a beautiful creature.</p>
