		<p>Friday, September 15, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  Went to Santa Croce in morning but B.B. was so cross about a baby that cried and a guardian who had a cold and sniffed that it was (for me) all spoiled. He was also perfectly and absolutely unreasonable about the chest of drawers. I think he half believes that the boys were extra careless about it because it was for him! </p>
		<p>  A perfect hopelessness came over me of ever getting behind his furious and unreasonable “complexes,” and having him see things straight. It is truly very sad and painful.</p>
		<p>  Mrs. Ross and Hutton dined here. We spoke of the War. </p>
