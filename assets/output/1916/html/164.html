		<p>Monday, July 3, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Nora Grifeo, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent </p>
		<p>  We went to a new place for our picnic dinner, Candigliana, off the pass to Borgo San Lorenzo a most lovely place. Miss Priestley, Nora, Geoffrey Cecil and I went in one car, and BB and Sybil in the other. </p>
		<p>  Nora is fearfully self-absorbed, and very idle, and she lays to be talking all day long, always about herself. She is very vain not about looks or dress but about her powers, her achievements, her character. But she has charming manners, and this makes her pleasanter to be with than Sybil, who is so much more of a person. She is getting Geoffrey ear, I am glad to say, for mine wonâ€™t hold out.</p>
