		<p>Thursday, March 30, Grand Hotel Siena</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent </p>
		<p>  We motored to Sarteano and found a man who, with some reluctance, took us to a cave whose entrance was blocked up. Found the owner’s son, who said they had walled it up because 5 years ago people came and stole the sponge stone at night (ours in the new garden!!). However he had it unpacked and we crawled in on our bellies like serpents in the slime for so fond in so, till we got into a cavern where we could stand. It was very weird, but a little sufficed Geoffrey and me, and we were soon hauled out panting and muddy, and then Cecil went on with Parry and explored the whole set of caverns from which, it became clear, our stone had been stolen.</p>
		<p>  It is all very mysterious. The young man said his mother wouldn’t sell. </p>
