		<p>Saturday, June 17, I Tatti</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey Scott, Naima Löfroth</p>
		<p>  Scirocco</p>
		<p>  A quiet day such as I like and corrected proofs, and Geoffrey, who wastes too much time! Since Marcella Michela came on the scene he has really form rather slack. </p>
		<p>  BB had tea with Sybil, and Geoffrey and I walked on Monte Senario. </p>
		<p>  Sybil is still going on about Nora’s visit. Lucky she doesn’t know about this silly ugly business with Miss Belle Greene. </p>
