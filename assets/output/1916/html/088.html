		<p>Wednesday, March 29, Grand Hotel, Siena</p>
		<p>  With Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Nello and Yoï and Toesca and De Nicola came to lunch, Yoï pretty again but so false!    Then Geoffrey, Cecil and I motored over here. Cecil saw a man who offered to get us the sponge stone, but who was very mysterious about it.</p>
