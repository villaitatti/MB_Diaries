		<p>Thursday, May 11, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>  Fine</p>
		<p>  All by ourselves again. Even Geoffrey didn’t come up. </p>
		<p>  Cecil lunched here, nice creature. </p>
		<p>  Bernhard and I had a delicious walk in the laghetto. </p>
		<p>  He dined with Sybil. </p>
		<p>  I read this yesterday to Mr. Plaisted: </p>
		<p>“I loathed you, Spoon River. I tried to rise above you, </p>
		<p>I was ashamed of you. I despised you</p>
		<p>As the place of my nativity.</p>
		<p>And there in Rome, among the artists,</p>
		<p>Speaking Italian, speaking French,</p>
		<p>I seemed to myself at times to be free</p>
		<p>Of every trace of my origin.</p>
		<p>I seemed to myself at times to be free</p>
		<p>Of every trace of my origin,</p>
		<p>I seemed to be reaching the heights of art</p>
		<p>And to breathe the air that the master breathed,</p>
		<p>And to see the world with their eyes.</p>
		<p>But still they’d pass my work and say:</p>
		<p>‘What are you driving at, my friend?</p>
		<p>Sometimes the face looks like an Apollo’s, </p>
		<p>At other it has a trace of Lincoln’s.’</p>
		<p>There was no culture, you know, in Spoon River,</p>
		<p>And I burned with shame and held my peace.</p>
		<p>And what could I do, all covered over</p>
		<p>And weighted down with western soil,</p>
		<p>Except aspire, and pray for another</p>
		<p>Birth in the world, with all of Spoon River</p>
		<p>Rooted out of my soul?”</p>
