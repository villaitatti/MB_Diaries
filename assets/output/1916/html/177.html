		<p>  Eugénie Strong</p>
		<p>  Shopped with Eugénie, an awful business, as she is so undecided about everything.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey had Marcella to dinner and rather raged at her for being neither a girl nor a woman. She is teasing, but cannot somehow really see it. I think she is a little cracked.</p>
		<p>  B.B. stayed in bed all day.</p>
		<p>  Eugenie and I called on Mrs. Ross.</p>
