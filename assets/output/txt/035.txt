In the evening we went to see the Jarvel Company, playing “Le Medecin malgrè lui”, and found it – not for us. Childish horseplay. Ray and BB and Jeanne away before the 2nd piece, La Carosse du Sacrement.

The Pancrazis, Moravia, and Pasquali (philosophist) to lunch. Another parrot-cage.

Tuesday, March 10,1931
Miss Lowenthal and Kennedy came to tea. The later made BB miserable by showing him photos of the wretched Pistoia monument which he insists on publishing as Verrocchio’s own work. Cecil Pinsent came to dine, most agreeable. Morra left.
