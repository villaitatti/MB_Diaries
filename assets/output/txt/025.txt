1930
Tuesday, January 20,1931
With BB away, I lost the desire to record our days. I had a splendid long visit fromAlys, from Karin and her children, from Christopher and Barbara and their father
(Ray stayed at home to get a new set of teeth and finish her book on Mrs. Fawcett).
We had great doing, 2 Fairy dress parties. Barbara and I went to Aulla and Lerici for 3 days, Alys and Olivier and Ann to Aulla for a night. The 4 Waterfields and their nice pupil, Peggy Macdonnell came and stayed and meet with me.
At last I had to say goodbye to all my beloved guests. By that time Senda Abbot had come, and presently van Rensselaer Lee. We had the Kennedys and Vaval√† to dine
and a Mrs. Stern to lunch.
