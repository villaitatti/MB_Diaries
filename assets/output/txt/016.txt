Logan left at two.
Tuesday – Monday, October 21-27,1930, Siena
We had a truly enchanting week in Siena, sight and landscape seeing. Alda came with us, but returned to Florence on Saturday when we went with the Superintendent ofart at San Geminiano to see his improvements there (Peleo Bac[c]i).
  One day we drove to Castagneto del Bosco and lunched with De Biondis. We met our old Mrs. Godfroy, who spends her life dancing, and her Sec.? Mr. Whitaker. Also a rather deaf brother of Biondis.

Nelly Mackay came to lunch and was larmoyante and sentimental, and yet rather appealing. Vavalà came for the day and have a gap at the Lists.
Houghton and the Waterfields came to tea, and a Mrs. Virginia (Francis) Peabody from Cambridge to dine, an attractive cultivated young widow. Fausto knocked BB down and hurt his sciatic nerve so that he failed and had to go to bed.
