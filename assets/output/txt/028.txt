Morra /Trevy / Senda, Gordon Waterfield and wife 2 nights
Tuesday, February 3,1931
I have been ill with a sharp attack of cystitis. They had Placci and Lord and Lady Howard of Pembroke and their son to dine, Giuliana Benzoni and Placci to lunch. Mr. and Mrs. Law and Miss Law to lunch and so on. 
Trevy and Morra are staying here. I am up to night and feel like a revenante, with my place fully taken, it makes me free. I have engaged Betty Macdonnel as Secretary
a dear little creature.

Still in bed, but better. Vavalà came, but oppressed by some secret mis fortune she closely heirted at poor thing. Morra’s friend, Loria, came to lunch, Fokker to tea.
Thursday, February 5,1931
Morra stayed in his room with a cold, but his novelist friend, Alvaro came to lunch, looking half negroid, a Calabrese. Mr. and Mrs. Law and Aubrey came to dine.
Friday, February 6,1931
Vavalà, Ojetti and Pancrazi to lunch, Lützons to dine.
