1930
brown-coloured hair and sharp prudish
features. We could not discover any particular spark of intelligence in her, except a look 
sometimes in her legs. 
Monday, September 30,1930
Mrs. Lanier brought up her brother, Jim, and his turn-soul (?), Mr. Paul Frerejean, and a young Dame, countess Bl√ºcher-Altona, to tea. Mr. Lanier has an even more restricted mind than his sister, but I think more aimable. He has a house in a rose-garden in Provence near Les Beaux and seems to be happy in his homosexual college. Frerejean has the suavity and culture of the best of his type.
The young Dame seemed very wooden.
Later Edith Wharton and Gilliard Lapsley arrived by motor from Salsomaggiore, with two Pekinese.
