to find that De Marinis had brought Benedetto Croce to tea. Moravia also had stayed in from lunch. Croce was most interesting, as always, but I was so utterly tired (for the Greggs did not respond enliveningly to the beauty I showed them), that I finally had to excuse myself and creep off to rest. Gregg talked interestingly about his last post, Romania. He said that Antoine Bibesco was a despicable cabotin and his wife (Asquith’s daughter) little better.

Friedländer of the Berlin Museum came to lunch, a quiet, able, agreeable man.
Afterwards his friends, frau and Doktor P[erles] came and stayed endlessly looking at the collection. She is a very sub. Rubens plus German type, but no doubt pleasing to the Herr Geheimath Friedländer. He, by the way, said he was ready to collaborate with me in a list of “Sacred” pictures, he doing the early Flemish and Germans, I, the Italians. Kenneth Clark and Jane arrived. He is ill and went at once to bed.
