Vavalà came up to stay 2 nights, hoping to break the evil spell of her illness. Also Miss Wiskermann, who disguises perhaps an intelligent person by a mask of giggling.
She and Lina and Morra went to a concert. BB and Nicky left for Hyères.

The same. Called on Mrs. Clark at Poggio Gherardo, and tasted the Vermouth Lina spent the day making. Lina told us some of her 7 – ex experiences in the evening. She was most entertainy. Barbara arrived at midnight, pretty tired from a week wild sociability in London.
