1930

Mr. and Mrs. Archie Mackay and Mme de Saint Blancard (?) came to lunch. As Alda said, you don’t meet such people! The French lady complained heavily of people punching her (but not today) under the table, Nellie indulged in high-flown metaphysical sentiment, and her husband bored us all. Late as Mme Serristori and Sophie Bossi-Pucci came to tea, the latter bringing her 3 children (one not yet born). She seemed very distraite, perhaps her condition absorbed her. 
  Jane came down for tea.

I had my Day in Bed (one of them), and thoroughly enjoyed it, reading Freud’s last book: “Civilization and some of its Discontents” (reasonable, wise, noble) and “Shutters of Snow” a madhouse book, very vivid. Edmund Houghton came with his stereoscopic views of their trips in India, and Pellegrina.

Day in bed, but up to see Percy Lubbock at dinner. He made a charming impression of detached and humorous observation and of shrewd kindness upon us all.
