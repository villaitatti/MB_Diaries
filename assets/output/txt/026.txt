1930
Today Lina came to tea, and Frau Lene Schneider-Kainer, fresh from Thibet and Siam and China. Very interesting. She made studies in the Thibetan Monastries, and special studies of the women of the East.
Lee is still here. Senda stays till we go to Africa. Lovely to have BB and darling Nicky at home again!
