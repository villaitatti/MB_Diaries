Corrected BB’s “Homeless Pictures” article till Mr. and Mrs. Hammer came to lunch. I wish I liked them more. We went down to see the new car.
Barbara writes, a propos of the music in the Chapel of New College… “It was too much for a poor creature who hasn’t been to Church for 4 years! But I think it’s one of the greatest pleasures in life to feel that a thing is too beautiful to be borne one second longer and yet if it stops you will be heartbroken”    
Naima came for the weekend.

Carlo Placci came to lunch bursting with “important secret information”, which of course turned out to be nothing at all. I thought BB was too hard on him, but he was very good natured, and there was no real quarrel. At lunch Logan uttered the interesting technical observation that novellists [sic] often convey and individualize character by reproducing actual tricks of speech, but BB was dreadfully contentious, and when he was proved wrong said “It hasn’t the slightest interest”. I suppose it is his digestion! Alda and Bertie came to dine. Jane Clark was rather ill in the night.
