dine at the Consul’s to meet Mr. and Mrs. (Julia Marlowe) Sothern, charming personalities. The rest of the guests, Mrs. Matteini, Mr. Cooksaw, the Struisons, were just people.

Nesta de Robeck came to lunch, a dear, but a trifle too eager in agreeing with me. She sees the Origo situation just as we do, also the character of Lady Sybil, but BB is more lenient to the latter. I called on the Struisons. I think it is (for us) a cul de sac.

I had my tiresome nevritis treatment. Ugo Ojetti, Sua Eccellenza, came to lunch, very pleased with his election to the Academy and his visit to the King at San Rossore. I feel very seasick from the ether in my ointment and went to bed, and then the Countess Rosales found me. I liked her better than I used to. John Walker 8°, BB’s new Disciple, came to tea. He will be nicer when he is older and some of the American paints is washed off him. His laugh is painful. But he seems intelligent and fun and agreeable.
