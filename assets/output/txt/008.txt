1930
Wednesday, October 1,1930
Ruth Wolf, enormously smellowed and improved by misfortune and failure, came to lunch – now a really fascinating man. Also a Graf Erbach Fürstenan and his spouse came. He looked like a coarsely painted Tintoretto. He writes on Manuscripts of the XIII Century. She talks on domestic matters. I thought I should die of sleepiness!
In the evening Cecil Pinsent and Ruth Draper came to dine. The latter
gave us the new “piece”, “Three Women”, and a much longer and more profound thing that she has so far done. Very remarkable. She grows handsomer and handsomer, as intelligence and success touch her features. Mrs. Lanier’s face is going exactly the
opposite way.
