Mrs. And Miss Hermann came to lunch. The daughter was very enthusiastic, and so was a Freulein Fülterer who came and photographed our Gagini statue. John Walker and his friend, Eugene Williams, an upper-faced lady, came to lunch, had a walk with BB, and finally Lucy Donelly and Edith Frick came to tea and to stay for 2 or 3 nights.
