Senda, Trevy, Morra
Signorina Accascina from Palermo came to lunch. The Waterfields and Mr. Sands to dine. I took Johnny and Mr. Sands to see Lochoff, and then left flowers on Mr. Lathrop, who is very ill. Vaval√† and Sig. Castelfranco (of the Uffizi) came to tea.
We have alas all come to the conclusion that poor Senda is a thundering bore.
