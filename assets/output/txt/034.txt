A trembling visit from Vaval√† in the morning. I cannot see into it, and both BB and Nicky seem to me rather in the wrong. I must just pay her out of my own pocket. 
Rezia Rasponi and her daughter came to lunch.
BB and I went down to the Consulate to sign our Italian wills.

I was in bed with fever and apnea, on by an inoculation against Maltese fever etc. But I crawled out after dinner to see the Sessions. Ray dined at the Anreps with May Boyle.
