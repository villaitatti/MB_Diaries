Rain of course              The Zangwills
Placci came to lunch, and he and B.B. nearly quarrelled over politics. BB. woke up in a mood of fearful exasperation. He seems to feel that no one should do anything without reference to him, and his memory is awfully inaccurate about what he has said. Both Nicky and I notice it. However—
Nicky had a long walk with Geoffrey who said he had decided that it upset him too much to go on seeing her. He must organize his life apart from her and from his past, as it is all too painful.
And I could cure him of his love for he[r]—kill or cure. How blindly we live.
Bardini came brought up his lovely Fra Angelico for BB to see.
Geoffrey came alone to dine, Sybil being ill from some imprudence or other. He was amusing, but I feel our friendship is really ended. We had very little left in common.
