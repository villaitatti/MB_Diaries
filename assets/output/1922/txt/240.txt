 {straddling both pages} Kissingen
The day passed (after baths, etc) in an excursion to Würzburg, where B.B. and I were carried away by Tiepolo’s gorgeous decorative frescoes over the great staircase, and also in the mirror room. What brio! What colour! What composition! What movement!
Nicky couldn’t like them—of course it’s too big a jump for her to take from Romanesque and Egyptian art. She must train her muscles a bit before such a leap.
We liked the Riemenschneiders also, and found the Cathedral in execrable taste, but still amusing.
We quarreled about the Schloss garden, which Nicky and I thought to [sic] stuffed with unmethodical planning, too “giardino inglese” and B.B. adored. He got quite hairy. But of course we were right!
Nicky read aloud Lytton Strachey on Voltaire in England, much the best of his essays in the new book.
