11 St. Leonard’s Terrace S.W. 3
Nice day at last
Shopped. Went to see Logan who is still in bed, with a catheter, trying to get his incision wound to heal.
Britten lunched with me at Verry’s—and complained of our neglect: but he has never taken any trouble to make himself acceptable. Poor old man.
Jim Whitall called on me and made a very nice impression. He is maturing unexpectedly well.
