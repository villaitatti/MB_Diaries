B
Shopped with Barbara all day. Called on Logan in his nursing home, and went myself to his doctor, who said I had varicose veins in the bladder and must expect a great deal of discomfort. He hopes to cure Logan, but is not sure.
Got home for dinner to which B.[arbara] sat up. She was very naughty about going to bed afterwards, but came round, conquered herself. _____ impressed everyone, and seemed to cling to me and love me more for having been firm with her. O how I do love that child. It is awful!
Grace and the Heaton Ellises are here.
