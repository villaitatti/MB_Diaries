Winter Palace
Bonté and I went to Kus by the 6.10 train, as she had a girls’ school to inspect there. How competent, how tactful she was!! I admired her enormously. We had our breakfast in the train, but had to eat another banquet at the school, and still another at the house of the Mamour (major), whose wife scrabbled on the piano for us and miauled to a lute. Awful life. She never goes out not even into the garden!! Has no friends, and of course sees no men except her heavy fat oldish husband.
Karnak sunset and again Moonlight. Nicky thrown from her donkey, but only bruised. I was relieved when I heard her voice telling the dragoman not to whip the donkey!
