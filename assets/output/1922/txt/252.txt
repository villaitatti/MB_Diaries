Windy and cold with gleams of sunshine    Big Chilling
 {straddling both pages} All 4 children, Ray, Sarah N[ordhoff]
Read “The Road to Endor” to Barbara, who is remarkably intelligent about it and never misses a point.
Walked ram of Hook.
Began to read Ray’s “Marching On” aloud. It is really good.
Gave Ray the £150 premium for her new house, which seems a very suitable place for her to live.
Karin says she is going on with her “Psycho-Analysis” if it takes ten years!
Poor Sarah’s unfortunate daughter isn’t pleased with the place found for her, and her mother doesn’t know what to do with her. The girl has no interests outside of horses. The anxiety is making Sarah quite ill.
