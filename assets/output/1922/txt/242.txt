 {straddling both pages} Kissingen
Drove Motored to Brückenau and had tea with Nicky and her friend, Fräulein Austen-Sachsen, a delicate, cultivated woman of 40 odd, who is drifting towards Catholicism. She has lost all her money in Russia and has to live on her friends and is trying to find work.
Interesting talk in evening, chiefly about Catholicism.
Poor old Kar[in] is deep in her P.[sycho] A.[nalysis] still, and she says Adrian isn’t really finished either. It’s fantastic! I compare her to Andromeda chained to a (Tyrde___) sock with a Freudian born monster gnashing his teeth at her, while she waits for Perseus—Gl_r__ to deliver her!
