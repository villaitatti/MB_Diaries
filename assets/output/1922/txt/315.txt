Rain
Busy over nothings. Took Aunt Janet to town at 4, called fruitlessly at Bardini’s and then went to the “O___so Bianco” for tea with Miss Halsey, who had to put an apex on her own insignificance—Lady Bateman! Aunt Janet was a usual raging against Lina’s husband. As he knows she hates him, why does he go back every day to draw a branch of kaki in her garden? She was so happy to be rid of him!
A young Dutch dealer named De Burler came to lunch—no impression.
Looked at medieval sculpture photos. in evening.
