Cloudy, sunny, drops of rain, very cold
Went out to electrical doctor and dentist and with Mrs. Devonshire to see some late mosques on the slope of the Citadel. She and Patricolo lunched with us, and we went with him to the Tomb of Imam Shafei [sic] (most beautiful, with its colors. The dome recalled in its way of swimming tribune at SS Annunziata by Alberti. Then we went to that wonderful Albanian Monastery and saw the view in a dramatic light.
Furness, Baxter etc. called.
