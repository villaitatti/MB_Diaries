St. Arabia. Nile
Rowed to barrage and came down the Cataract in a row-boat. Not at all equal to the 2nd Cataract, altho fine, with strange diorite-granite rocks.
Bonté lunched with us, and I went with her to inspect the “Trades’ School” (bought some linen) and also the ambulatory eye-hospital. Then I had to take a felucca to join the boat wh. had moved to the N. and we went on donkeys to the Granite Quarries and saw the half hewn obelisk and the sunset.
