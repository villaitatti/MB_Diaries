Fine   Lady Kitson
Miss Kitson
Salvemini
Lady Kitson and her daughter came up to lunch. Of all the thousands of things I could say to Geoffrey, I only thanked him for writing frankly about himself. We are too far off even to understand eachother [sic] again. What a waste of human affection and effort.
Usual tea-fight.
