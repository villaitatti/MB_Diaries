On the Nile. SS. Egypt
We got off at 10, Eliza rather collapsed.
Spent the day with the Cecil Firths at Sakkara, seeing the Tomb of Ti and Meru and the burial chamber inside the Pyramid of Onas, with walls of alabaster inlaid with  precious marbles. It was indescribably beautiful coming back to the boat by sunset.
