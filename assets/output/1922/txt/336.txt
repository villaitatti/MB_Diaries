Glorious              Mrs. Cameron
“M_ra__ Summer”
Went ahead with the notes.
Mr. Offner came and stayed to lunch. Took B.B. and Lizzie Cameron to call on the Strongs and first a walk around an old “rampart walk” at Fiesole. Lizzie is so short-sighted, she sees almost nothing. She and B.B. called on Sybil while Nicky and I walked towards home
Chitchat in [evening]. One _____ to gossip with her.
