Gradually warmer and finer
Ray and Julia left in the morning. Children bathed.
After lunch we motored in, all the chn., Salvemini and I, to meet Dermod McCarthy, who arrived alone, whereat again Salvemini wondered, for a pretty boy of 11 could not safely take a long journey alone in Italy.
Stopped for the “Un-birthday Party”
[Barbara] and Dermod rushed down to the beach to bathe and had a “glorious” time.
