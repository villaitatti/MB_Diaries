Really Feb; 27th
Too tired to do anything, but BB and Nicky spent the day at Medinet Habu. I wrote to Karin for her 33rd birthday (Mar. 10), to Barbara (for her whooping cough) to Creswell, Mrs. Devonshire, Lisa Curtis for Ralphâ€™s death, Paul Manship, Alys.
Mr. W. H. Truman, Ed? Inspector, dined with us and was most interesting about native customs.
Met Lady Carnarvon.
This is Monday Feb. 27th
