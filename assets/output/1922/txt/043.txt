Stopped at Beni Hassan and saw the sights, and enjoyed them. The trip is too enchanting!
I wrote  to Barbara
There was an old Gram in a boat
Who said “I’m afloat! I’m afloat!”
When they said “It’s the Nile”
She burst into a smile
And learned on the Nile and the boat
The landscape as well as the Art is composed of “Tactile Values”!
