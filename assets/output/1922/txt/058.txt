Wadi Halfa
Sailed and moved up the 2nd Cataract to Abu Seer (awful climb and grand view of the 15 m. of “Cataract” stream with black masses of diorite). We saw neither crocodile, papyrus, lotus nor Flamingo, and hence were all disappointed, but the cataract well repaid the danger. The other boat had its bottom knocked in.
We bought a small bronze cat from the dragoman, Barlos, for £15.
