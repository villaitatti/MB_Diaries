Naimi{straddling both pages} I Tatti
Fair weather
Reached Florence at 7. Naimi was kindly waiting to greet me. Found everything in good order at home, but Colombo not arrived.
Went to see Aunt Janet—no change, her life is taken up in adoring David and his family, and loathing Lina’s family and being annoyed with Lina. I drove her to town and left some letters and did some errands, picked up Naimi and came home.
Naimi is in love again, and feels happy and jung (as she calls it)[.] I am so glad. But my Lord what a Bore people in love are, saying _____ and _____ the same thing. Still I sympathize, and hope it may end in a happy marriage
B.B. and Nicky still at Milan
