Nicky went over to visit her friend, Fräulein Austen-Sachsen, at Brückenau.
B.B. and I motored to Kloster Kreuzberg and climbed up along the Way of the Cross to the top—a most enchanting excursion. One should however, take the day to it.
In the morning Dicky ___t came to ask B.B. about the picture market, as he has his Frankfort grandfather’s (named Gaus!) collection to dispose of.
We had a letter from Creswell in Cairo saying that the King has been told that he, Creswell, had spoken against him, so he refuses to continue the grant for work on his history of Arab architecture in Cairo. I wrote and said that we were willing to promise him £200 a year for 2 years to help him go on.
