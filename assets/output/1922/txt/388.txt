Cloudy           {straddling both pages} Barbara
Bessie
Alys
{straddling both pages} Mrs. Hooker
Barbara and Miss Pryme and Dermod arrived at 7.45. Bliss to see Barbara again. She brought her own __i_ de___ in pastelles by Simon Bussy (her uncle), and B. B. likes it.
Took the chn. to call on Johnny and the Hapgoods, and they played in the podere. They are so good, and Barbara very attractive and pretty.
