Gazzada
Letters of all sorts to write.
In the afternoon we motored with Guido to see the Bramantinos at Mezzano and the Romanesque church at Olgiate, but we lost our way and it was long and very tiring. However, we like being with dear Guido.
Talked with the daughter in the evening. She is uncultivated and somewhat dull, but like her mother attractive. They say she has been afflicted with nymphomania, but she seems to have got over it.
