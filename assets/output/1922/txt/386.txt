Rain   {straddling both pages} Alys
Bessie
Lovely quiet [morning] of work—I hardly ever get it.
We called on [Margaret] Strong, but B.B. lost his temper and [would] not go in. Bessie says he has exactly his father’s bad temper, so I suppose he can’t help it, but it is degrading and sordid, and I cannot get used to it, not after more than 30 years!!! It is idiotic of me. The poor things [sic] insides are all upset, that is the cause of his hereditary temper coming out.
We had the chance (he having walked home in a sulk) to call on the Polkinghames and Aunt Janet.
Pleasant evening looking at books
