Mr. Robert Benson   Fine
Lady Wake
Robert Benson and his daughter Lady Wake (wife of Hereward the Wake!) arrived in the morning. He is much aged (72), but is chatty and full of art gossip.
Took them to call on Lina and Aubrey, and in the afternoon we walked over the hill down to Gamberaia, which we saw.
