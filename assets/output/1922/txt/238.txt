Frankfort
Spent the morning at the Städelinstitut bringing the Director, Herr Swarzenski, back to lunch with the Dumarts at the Frankfürter Hof.
Ordered same wine, as it is very good and amazingly cheap there.
Motored home over Orb, but lost our way again for a bit. It was a less lovely drive than yesterday’s by the river.
Stopped at Gellenhausen and saw the Cathedral, with fine glass and statues by Riemenschneider.
I read aloud one of Geo.[rge] Moore’s stories in the new vol.[ume] {scratched}. Very flat and Chinese-y, but how well written.
