Got up for lunch, but certainly felt quite ill, so I went to bed till dinner. B.B. had Lionello Venturi for tea, and I had my tea with Logan, who diffuses a wonderfully calm, generous, genial spirit. It was most agreeable sitting in the Library, chatting comfortably and congenially with him in the evening.
We miss seeing Nicky, the darling creature, all the time.
For the first time she spoke with exasperation of Geoffrey, who is allowing himself to be eaten alive by Sybil, just as I predicted. In order to be “in show” (_____ takes in no one) he comes to see us once, very nervous about getting away, after 5 months absence, though he is close at hand for 5 days! Poor Geoffrey.
