55 Oakley St.
Chelsea.
Val Washington’s
5 children (including Dermod)house
Went to London taking Salvemini and Karin’s children to go to Firth Hendersons’. S.[alvemini] was jiggered to realize that one simply puts one’s luggage in the van, with no receipt! Not necessarily locked, either.
Shopped with Grace. It turns out that the Italian P.O. has sent word that it cannot accept registered letters any more! What an unheard-of state of anarchy!!
Called on Saidee, who turns out to have gravel in the kidneys. She is a bore, poor thing, but _____ get to head the sound of “Peg” (“Paig”)!! Very nice chat with Grace and Val in the evening. He is developing and has lost his _____ shyness.
Went to N.[ational] G.[allery] and liked, on the whole, the arrangement of the pictures.
