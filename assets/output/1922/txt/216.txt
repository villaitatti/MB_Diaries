To Mrs. Ross… “One’s heart is torn between sympathy and remorse and contempt and disgust. We drove all day along roads lined {added above} lined with trees dropping {main text} with fruit trees of all kinds, and loved the Germans for planting them and being honest enough to let everyone enjoy the fruits of his own trees, but then a bitter anger would surge up as one thought how the[y] cut down the all the fruit trees in France on their retreat. What an adorable people! But what infernal brutes!”
We saw {added but seemingly scratched} Ansbach Schloss, so charmingly done in XVIII styles, and then came on through Ellinger, with i[t]s fine XVIII Schloss and garden, to Nürnberg and saw all the Germanic Museum before a horrid lunch at the Grand Hotel filled with Oberamergauers [sic]. Saw Bamberg Cathedral and Platz and arrived here at 7.45
