Fine
Miss Tone came at 11.30 and sang Crusade and other mediaeval songs to us in the Library, till Dt. Steinmann bustled in and wouldnâ€™t listen, tiresome little man. Dr. Swarzenski and Herr von Hirsch from Frankfort came also to lunch, and stayed till I had driven Miss Tone as near to Baggazzano as I could and come back for them. I called on Mrs. Ross.
We looked at photos. of German Romanesque sculpture in the evening. Very expressive, but with a basis of grotesque that differentiates them from French work.
