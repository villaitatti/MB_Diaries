Furness
Mr. Robin Furness arrived at 7.45. I met him.
Luxor in morning. Karnac in Tea at Medinet Habu and a glorious walk along the cliffs, coming down at the Cooks’ Rest House.
It was very tiring, and my legs hurt me so that I cried in the night. I did not sleep till 5.30: but I had a wonderful experience of entering into the visual world of Egyptian art. It was like suddenly being able to read a language at whose unfamiliar alphabet you had been staring for months.
In the case of Egyptian art, our standards don’t apply any more than our “Golden Urn” standards apply to Wordsworth. If he waisn’t pure poetry, he is quite as great in another way. It is days since we sniffed at the “execution”.
