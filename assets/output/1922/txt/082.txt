Luxor
_____ 29th 1st which I wrote by mistake.

On the 28th Philom√®ne de Levis-Mirepoix arrived. I met her in the morning.
Went to the Luxor Temple in morning and Medinet Habu for tea and saw Tomb of Ramose [sic], perhaps the very finest of all except Sakkara, and on a grander scale than those.
Had tea with Winlocks.
