Abu Simbel—
There are no words!
On each side of the great sculptured rock façade pans out a red-gold cataract of sand. Towards sunset we climbed to the top for the unforgettable sunset view. I sat on the sand and slid down, sand and all, without a line of drapery being disarrayed. B.B. said “I am here to look, not to play” and thumped painfully down along the moraine of rocks at the side.
The whole thing’s incredible!!
The “petrified love story”, [sic], as Wahrlich called it, Rameses’ Temple for Nefertari, is also very grand. The great figures seem to be marching out of the mountain.
The scenery is past imagining. Hundreds of natural but marvellously [sic] symmetrical pyramids are scattered over the golden sand of the desert.
