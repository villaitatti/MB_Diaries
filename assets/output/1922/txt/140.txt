I Tatti
Logan, Trevy {continued on the facing page}
This is Friday the 28th
Geoffrey came over, very pale and thin, trembling as he used to do when he was 20, and most miserably unhappy. He said if there had ever been any harmony between him and Sybil, to make a fond of happy relations, and he had then got her on his nerves as he has now done, he would say he had to go clear away and be left to himself for two years. But she has been so considerate, within her limitations, and things have been so beastly, owing to me and to his falling in love with Nicky, that he feels he came to ask for it. It is clear that the worst I thought about her misuitability [sic] as a wife for him is realizing itself. Let us hope she’ll take a lover—if she hasn’t done so already in Percy Lubbock—and leave him alone. This is all Friday the 28.
Wrote to Lady Sybil, Lady Colefax, Governor of Jerusalem, Cecil Pinsent, Ray, Caterina Kerr-Lawson.
