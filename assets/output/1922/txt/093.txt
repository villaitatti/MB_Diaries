Expedition to Abydos—3 hrs. riding across the cultivation. It nearly killed me with pain in my knees, but it was worth it. It is I think the greatest monument of the XIX Dynasty in Egypt, the sculptures being of that delightful kind of the paintings in the Tomb of Seti. It is true that the touch is less delicate and nervous than in the Tombs of Ramesi and Cha-en-het, which recall Desiderio and Agostino da Duccio [sic] at their best, but the compositions are more varied and more like “compositions” in our sense.
We ached to look on last on these {long arrow} proud, self-asserting Kings thrusting symbols of life into the noses of the Gods, gazing at them with level eyes, as powerful as their own deities.
Certainly this is the loudest bray the human donkey has ever brayed into this world of mysteries!
