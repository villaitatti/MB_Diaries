Rather brighter    Big Chilling
Motored with [children] in morning. Called with Alys on Lady Dilke and the St. John Hornbys for tea, and met Ray and Barbara at {scratched} 6 at Fareham. Barbara has grown out of all recognitionâ€”ten years old! She was enchanted with the Doll she found waiting for her.
Saidee spoiled an evening dribbling on about her family and capping all we said with pointless parallels. It is a disease.
B.B. and Nicky at Magdeburg.
