Cairo
Took B.B. to doctor who thinks he can restore vitality to the muscles of his stomach and intestines, and perhaps cure him!!
Then the Museum, where Mr. M___ joined us. B.B. was so infernally sniffy to me that I went off and wandered lonely as the rhinosceros [sic], enjoying the _____ and _____ tomb _____ discovered by an old friend Theodore Davis.
Cresswell came to lunch and we went to the Mamelukes’ tombs—Barkuk and Emir Kebir; Sultan Inam[.] The ‘’ domes are among the loveliest of the swimming effect, and faint colour date 1411. Pulpit Kaitbay. Had tea there and saw sunset from minaret.
The dear Quibells also came to lunch, the very nicest people we have met here.
Wrote to Bonté. Maurice is a “Sir”!
