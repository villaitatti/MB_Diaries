B.B. and I had a gorge of note-taking in the Gallery, when we met also the _____ and young Suarez and Mr. Waley from the Metropolitan Museum. We found lots of things, among them an unsuspected Sassetta.
In the afternoon BB and I called on the Meyergraefes and saw their ASTONISHING colour reproductions of pictures and drawings. Met also young Lahmann (of the Weisser Hirsch) who wants to establish a Sanatorium in Italy. We recommended Vallombrosa!
Doktor Sarre came to dine and was very pleasant, but he is a less picturesque talker than De Coq. Still he is awfully nice, and of course his diggings at Babylon Samarra, and his experiences in Persia and Bokara and Samarcand are fascinating. He is very learned and cultivatedâ€”a serious and learned Denman Ross.
