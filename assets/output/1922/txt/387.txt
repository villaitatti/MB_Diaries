Shopped for the childrenâ€™s party in the [morning].
A [young] painter from Smith College named Richard Bassett came to lunch and stayed on to tea. There came:
Mrs. RossMiss Cescas
Mr. Acton and also SonsByba
Mr. NiverMarchesa Farinola
MargaretRenata Borgata
Mr. and Mrs. [William] Ballett came to dine. He is the man who got a splendid treaty out of Lenin and Trotsky, which going sent on a mission by Wilson and Lloyd George, but because he showed his treaty to the English Premier first Wilson [would] neither see him or look at the Treaty. Think what that bit of petty vanity has cost THE WORLD!
