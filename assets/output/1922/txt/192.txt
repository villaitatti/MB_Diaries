In bed.
Karin arrived last night, full of longing for social life. I think she has been starved in that respect.
Lady Enniskillen called. She says that Mrs. Ernesto Fabbri has fallen in love and taken possession of her bro[ther]-in-law, Egisto, the other one Sandro having died. It is a sort of House-of-Usher situation.
The young men, Mr. Choate and Mr. Taff came to dine, very nice boys.
