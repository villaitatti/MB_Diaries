Rain           Boat from Hook of Holland to Harwich
The Städel and the Sculpture Museum in morning. Saw and approved a fine Tintoretto female portrait belonging to Baltic friends of Nicky’s.
Eliza and I took the 12.15 train and reached our boat at midnight.
I read Edith’s new novel “Glimpses of the Moon”, a flashionable tale of Squander___—most unpleasant really altho[ugh] she portrays the infinitesimal struggles of a couple to escape from those standards and values. I absolutely can’t see the point of such a book.
