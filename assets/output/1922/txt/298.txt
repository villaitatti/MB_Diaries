Karin on the Psycho-Analyst conference. “I was able to hear all that Ernest Jones had to say. I was thankful you had not managed to smuggle yourself in, for you would have exploded with mingled laughter and incredulity; as for B.B., it would have disgusted him for good. Occasionally lapsing into commonsense [sic] I was appalled myself”
Motored from Bâle to Zurich where we called for Miss Zeller and brought her to lunch. Then we went to the _____ Haus and saw the Italian pictures and arranged to get photos of them, and saw the M___ter and I went to her house and she wept over my “kindness” (I have sent her £5 a month since the beginning of the War)
Motored to Lucerne, talking of the real way to unite history, i.e. the development of art, science, {added above} thought, civilization, _____ the improvement of the earth. Breasted, —Santayan[a], —Brunnhes [sic] +  what will never be written, I fear, Berenson!
