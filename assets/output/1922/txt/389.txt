Dermod
Miss Pryme
Getting ready for the party, with Johnny Waterfield and the Hapgoods. Great games and adventures and chints and hair-breadth escapes. They are happy!!
The Bullitts came to lunch, and Alys took them and Bessie to call at Villa Medici, and then to engage rooms at the Aurora in Fiesole. They are one amusing pair.
