Drove Dr. Leusser and his two daughters to that charming little Bad, Br√ºchenau. Came home by an ex-military barrack-camp, near Hammelburg which is now used as a summer holiday place for poor town children. What a pull this will give Germany over the other countries that keep up their military organizations!
