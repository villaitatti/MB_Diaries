Train Paris to Berlin
A very satisfactory talk with Jo Duveen, Edward present and LÃ¶wengarde most of the time.
He said B.B. could offer pictures he did not want to private people
He said B.B. could buy anything urgent and important on his own authority.
He said he would really pay us quickly if we would cable him.
I also ___ed him about his wife and said he must give her a holiday from his overpowering self!
Eliz Lunched with Carey, and left with Eliza at 7.40 p.m. dining on the train.
