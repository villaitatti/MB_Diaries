Karin{straddling both pages} I Tatti
Naima
Geoffrey
{beginning about a third of the way down the page}
Mrs. Carrol and Miss Perkins came to tea.
Karin and Geoffrey went to Villa Medici and Le Balze, B.B. and the Perrys and Naima leaving them there while they went on “the Drive,” round behind Monte Senario.
Geoffrey read me Blake’s poetry; some I scarcely knew. He went away after dinner, leaving me with a sense of his hopeless misery. And he is very hard to bear in a hundred ways, alas.
