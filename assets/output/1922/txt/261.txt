FINE
_____ one fine day, and even this is cold and grew cloudy about tea-time.
We put Barbara and Dermod on the Ford collapsible boat on the Meon River at Titchfield and they peddled down to the mouth (about 2 m[iles]) we walking along the bank. It was bliss for them to do and bliss for us to watch their young heads gliding thro[ugh] the rushes. Dermod’s brother Michael came, a shy lout of 19, too grand to join the “children’s” games.
We had tea by the river, Cave meeting us with it in the car.
