{continued from facing page} Palace Luxor
Engaged Dragoman No. 1 Ahmet Abdallah, a nice, rather weak and silly but very tactful creature.
Went on donkeys with Bonté to call on the Winlocks at the “Magameum”, or rather to see the Quibells, who were there. Wandered over Der el Bahari with the Quibells and came back to tea. Saw some of the T.
Winlocks greenhorny and rather made Quibells darlings.
Found the Kitsons here. He is out of a Van Dyck picture, and very frail and appealing. He a typical (and v. nice) retired General, the daughter of 26 in the marriage market, but talking vaguely of a “career” instead.
