Monica Kitson ill in bed. Lady K. ailing, she looked old and haggard and her talk was certainly very dull.
{continued from the facing page} “wonderful people. But to write this letter I have been working like a dog, in fighting with a whole library of dictionaries and grammars. And I am tired like the Creator of nature after 6 days of his work. And I also rest like him. Blessed be his name. Amen”
G. Salvemini
