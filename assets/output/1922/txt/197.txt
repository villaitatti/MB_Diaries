Karin
Geoffrey
Perrys
Still in bed.
Mme. Salvemini and her daughter came to lunch and of course spent the day, but I scarcely saw her. She tires me awfully.
Geoffrey and Karin dined at the Villino, and I think G.[eoffrey] had a walk with Nicky in the afternoon, but she gets further and further away from her poor despairing _____.
Mrs. de Kaven came to dine, as idiotic about Spender and as full of herself as ever. I scarcely saw her, I felt too ill, but it was partly loathing.
