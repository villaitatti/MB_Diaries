At home in bed
Trevy
Pour
Reached Florence at 6.30 in a downpour. It is nice to be in oneâ€™s comfortable bed again. Giglioli came up and said I was to stay there until he found out what was the matter with me.
Alda and Bertie came in in the evening. She has grown thinner and looks rather beautiful.
B.B. is starting a cold.
