Nile boat
Saw Karnak. It is madly picturesque and of course it is HUGE. But uncouth, unhomely, not to be made terms with.
Saw Luxor Temple with M. Lacaud the general director of the Service des Antiquités. He said he didn’t believe there was any misticism [sic] in the Egyptian religion. Where they worshipped a Ram they worshipped the animal tout court, not as a symbol. He said Everything was painted, even the black granite statues.
Letters from poor Geoffrey.
