Rain but streaks of sun.        Zangwills
Nicky says that she thinks Geoffrey is coming to feel that his marriage might have been a happy and successful one if it hadn’t been for this household, me first, but w___st my bringing her here. She thinks if he cuts loose from us all, he will settle down to be quite as happy as his nature permits. Soit! I shall do nothing to hinder the happy (but to be totally unsympathetic) ending. It simply means I never knew him, and never would have cared for him if I had. How deluded one can be!
