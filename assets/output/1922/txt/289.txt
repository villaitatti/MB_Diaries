Shopped. Karin with her characteristic ___ty about practical affairs is getting a very expensive coat , which she didn’t doesn’t need, to the neglect of the things she does need. How one’s characteristics go through everything. B.B. finds mine do, and he adds to ferocity. Cynicism and mechanism, worrying. That I swear I don’t do! But he says I am totally unconscious so perhaps I don’t know. His awful remarks have given me a great distaste for life. Such a person as he describes had better not exist, and whatever may be the truth that apparently is the impression I make on the person who knows me best. And I swear I am absolutely an angel about Nicky, not ferocious but gentle, not cynical but sympathetic, not mechanistic but understanding. It is really hard that he gives me no credit for this, but as it is so much to his advantage {vertically along the left margin going up the page} he takes it for granted, for a right which it would be monstrous to make objections to. Well, well, if one must live, one does it for one’s self and one’s own inner satisfaction at doing nice things. Took K.[arin] and A[drian] to “Ariadne auf Naxos” in the evening
