In bedâ€”
A day of agony, dulled at last by morphine. I could not see anyone, nor even read till evening. Then I saw for a few moments Elisabetta Henraux, more grandly beautiful than ever, who sang superbly afterwards to the party (Nicky, Baron von Anrep, Riri Visconti Venosta, Alice De Lamar and Evangeline Johnson and their [Secretary]). {scratched} Also saw Alice and Evangeline to say goodbye, as they are rushing off tomorrow. I like Alice.
Bernard and the Perrys had Mr. Hale (the painter) and his patron Mr. Spelman to tea, also Maurice Brockwell.
The Henraux and Riri Visconti Venosta came to dine. Elizabetta looked too beautiful and sang divinely. I h___d her with my don _p__.
