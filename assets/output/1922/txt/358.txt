Fine

Worked. Answered Geoffrey’s letter, but I do not expect to write to him again, perhaps ever. We do eachother [sic] no good.
B.B. and Nicky and I had a walk over Fiesole, she called on Margaret Strong, B.B. on Sybil, and I took Mrs. Ross to the Consul’s Thanksgiving Day Reception. Awful old cats filled the reception rooms!
