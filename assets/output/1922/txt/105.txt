Errands. Cooks’ American Express etc etc. Engaged passage in Esperia April 10 to Venice.
Mrs. Devonshire and Mr. Creswell came to lunch, and she took Philomène out. We rested and wrote. I sent a big cheque of £471 from B.B. to Karin, and got very much upset about it. He does have to give them a lot of money. However, he does provide well for them, if with some uncomfortable reflections, and I am awfully glad and grateful. Still, the days of reckoning never pass without stirring up a lot of unhappiness. They, fortunately, don’t know it.
M. Monneret came to dine, a devoted student of early [Christia]n art, especially in the East.
