{straddling both pages} Hotel du Theatre des Champs Elys√©es Paris
Ray lunched with Carey and I came in for tea and found them still reorganizing the world! In the evening we went dined with her and Helen Flexner and Lucy Donelly, who had just arrived from U.S.A. Very nice talk. Carey is wildly stimulating.
Bought Ray a becoming hat.
