Rain and wind    Big Chilling
A milk diet day
Saidee developed a chill on the kidneys and took to her bed, with a hot-water bottle. I developed slight cystitis from the cold but am curing it with Logan’s “Cystopurin” (3 times a day, dissolved in water, after meals). Chatted with Saidee and played “Boat” with the children, wrote many letters and paid a lot of book bills. Too cold and rainy to walk.
B.B. and Nicky must be in Cassel today

Read Algar’s rather confused article on von Hügel’s books—very disappointing. He writes badly, and his thought seems unclear.
