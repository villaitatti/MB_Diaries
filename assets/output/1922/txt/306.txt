I took Rosa for a drive to San Miniato. She was sweet, but like a chicken in her mind. She fears she may have a cancer, poor woman.
Called on Lady Lister-Kaye (out)[,] Swarzenski (out), Mrs. Baldwin, Gladys Duchess of Marlborough’s Aunt, and Mrs. Hooker, and picked up Flora Priestly and drove her home. She and her ilk are “heart-brokenly” disappointed about Ireland, but lay it at the doors of too long a regime of British tyranny.
Called on Aunt Janet.
