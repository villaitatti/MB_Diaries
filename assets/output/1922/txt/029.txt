Fine day
Still in bed with bronchitis.
B.B. and Nicky went to {scratched} Hassan with the Residency party and then Mrs. D[evonshire] muddled away the rest of the morning stupidly.
Logan has called he {scratched} canâ€™t come. I am awfully disappointed. He is slower in getting over his operation than they thought.
B.B. and N. went to Creswell, and then B.B. called in the Countess of Villamarina.
