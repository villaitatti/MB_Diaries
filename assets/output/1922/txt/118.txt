Cairo
B.B. went out to Matariah and lunched with H.H. Prince Youssouf, a delicious lunch in a house of overwhelming gorgeur super-Rothschild. The Prince was like most princes, educated beyond his abilities. His [collection] was awful!
Nicky and I went to the Museum and Quibell, darling man, came around with us.
Mrs. Devonshire came to lunch. I felt very ill with the bronchial cold which is trying to break through my inoculation, so did not go out with B.B. and Nicky who saw again the Ma__a_i mosque, but I joined them at 5.30 at the Countess Villamarinaâ€™s where were Mrs. Kramer and Adamoli, Negrotti (Italian Ambassador), Gallarza, Gen. Wilson[,] Mme. Neguib Pascha ed altri.
Baxter, Truman and Anderson to dine, very nice.
Arab music at _____, I came home while the others {written sideways up the right margin of the page} went out on a night spree.
Wrote to Lady Colefax, Furness, Mrs. Dunham, Lady Kitson, E. Thomas.
