LucerneAn ideal hotel!
The festa of a local Saint and worse than a British Sunday! The Police go around to fine anyone who does business. We had to sneak into the Steinmeyer-Böhler picture-shop, and the police actually came and tried the door. We spent the day there looking at their remarkable coll[ection] of Italian pictures, antique jewellery and medieval objets. It is quite wonderful what they have got together! We lunched with them, and when I came back for a half an hour’s nap, B.B. up and bought a little picture by Ercole Roberti for 12000 Swiss francs. They said that every single thing in Mr. Wendlandt’s house is for sale! He is entirely a dealer, not a collector, but yet he does live with great taste and refinement.
Alys writes that Logan’s wound is not yet healed and probably never will be. It is dreadful.
