Karin called. Her Analyst won’t allow her to speak of her treatment! But she seemed well and jolly.
Went to the Völkerkunde Museum and saw the Turfan frescoes and statues with their finder, Doktor De Kok. Chinese-Indian-Greek influence. c. VII to IX centuries.
Went to Tristan und Isolde in the evening. A lot of it is boring, but when it is great it is divine. If it were 2 hours long it would be perfect.
