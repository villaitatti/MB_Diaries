Fine!!
A GLORIOUS day. The children say I am “God”, ‘because I’m so kind’—a view of the Eternal scarcely shared by adults since 1914. I propounded the War to Barbara, who said “Well, it was God’s War, to conquer the Germans”. “But who made the Germans?” “The Devil” “O, Barb, think again—” “Gram, it couldn’t be God; it makes it all too confusing”.
The Pond and Boat entirely absorbed the children all day, with intervals of “flying” on a contraption Regis made
{a drawing of the “contraption”—a swing tied to a tree branch that the children can access by climbing a ladder from which they jump to “fly” on the swing}
