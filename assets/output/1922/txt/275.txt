Hotel du Théatre des Champs-Elysées
6 Avenue Montaigne Paris
Cold
cloudy
Called with Ray on the Thorolds and bought some of their chairs and curtains.
Lunched with Lady Strachey and saw Simon Bussy’s remarkable Animal pictures. They should have a success when he exhibits them next month. His pastel of Barbara is finished and is really very charming.
At 3 we left the Vit___ Hotel and motored to Croydon. There Ray discovered she had forgotten her passport—!! But they let her get onto the airplane (Handley-Page) and we flew over Deal and Boulogne and Beauvais to Paris, reaching the Hotel Crillon (having motored from the landing-place, Le Bourget) at 7, a swift, well-arranged, comfortable journey. The only drawback is the noise. The chief thing I noticed was that the sea looked solid under a thin veil of waves.
Saw Carey for a minute but dined by ourselves at the Lapérouse.
