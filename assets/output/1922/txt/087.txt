El Kab        Mahamid
Train at 10 reaching Mahamid at 12. Incredible donkeys awaited us and conveyed us—somehow—to the Rest House at El Kab where Mr. Somers Clarke and luncheon awaited us. He is over 80, of the disappearing type, unchanged by residing abroad, sturdy and vain and ruling the natives. They seem to adore him. Certainly there’s a bit of “Number 2” in it, probably innocently.
He showed us El Kab, and we sailed up in his felucca to the house he built himself in a cliff over the Nile.
It revealed possibilities of life here. But I should not attempt being a hermit without plenty of money to build a comfortable house, get good food and service and a supply of books!!
