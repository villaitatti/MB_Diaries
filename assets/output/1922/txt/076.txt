Luxor
Patricolo
BB 
To the Luxor Temple with the French diggers MM. Kuentz and Bruyère and Patricolo in the morning and with the same to Karnac for the whole afternoon. Nicky and I went to the Fair, but it was crowded, noisy, hot and dusty, and there wasn’t much to see, except shouting Arabs and camels and donkeys.
In the evening we talked with Miss Franklin, a sculptress, her cousin the young Samuel (son of the Commissioner for Palestine) who is going up to Balliol next term. He reminded me acutely of Bertie when he was young.
