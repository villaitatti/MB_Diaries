Monday, January 2, 1922, Shepheard’s Hotel. Cairo
Cold worse.
Cloudy morning fine
Storrs called for us at 9.30 and we went to the Bazaars, which he knows like his pockets. He is suspiciously intimate with “Jack Cohen”, “Dimitri” etc.
Bonté Elgood came to lunch, charming radiant creature, and accompanied us with Mrs. Devonshire to see the Palace of Bestat
 and a dear little Qaitbay mosque of Cairi Bek [sic] {long space} with a domed tank, and big ablution tank, 4 liwans (the side ones v. small), pen court, fine marble columns of mirhab. Also a falling to ruin Palace near by with one open loggia and a lovely musharahi in the harem. BB. and Mrs. D. went on, but I drove Bonté to her train, and called on Eliza at the Cheziral Hospital (Anglo-American). She has a lovely quiet room, and a nice nurse, but she looks dying, v. white and all teeth, like a skull. Had a 4th varicose veins electrical treatment, and came home to find Mr. Russell here (Chief of Police), a handsome sporting man, whose wife, BB. says, has a mind like a yard measure that only bends at same places.
{written vertically halfway down the left margin} Mrs. Bazil called.
