Hotel Germania, Karlsruhe
Went to Darmstadt and the Keyserling came to lunch. He thinks he is a sort of Western Bhodissatva [sic] or Incarnate Wisdom. I found it amusing, but B.B. was awfully depressed. His wife, a Bismarck, is a sweet and loving girl who evidently does not criticize him. Tagore and a Rabbi he has just discovered are the 3 existing Saviours of mankind. He reminded me of Mother’s famous remark “I know 13 Christs living in the suburbs of London”. B.B. would not go, but I went to their house and saw the 2 little babies (boys). The house is what we should call {scratched} M.C., stuffy and tasteless. He assured me that his slightest word was charged with deep meaning, “Tension” and “Rhythm” _____ this year’s doctrine, but I was tactless eno[ugh] to say that Pritchard had been preaching them for years. The Prophet was distinctly annoyed and felt _____ it was another sort of tension.
