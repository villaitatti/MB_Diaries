Very fine
Quiet morning distributing notes and grappling with the Income Tax. They want particulars of our statements of 1919, but we have forgotten them!
Placci came to lunch. He said that what that charlatan Dâ€™Annunzio calls his fall from the Tarpeian Rock was being pushed out of the window when his mistress found him making love to her little sister behind the window-curtain. Would the fall had killed the dangerous wretch!
Lady Bateman and her young nephew Henry Clifford came to tea. She is as dull as Rosa Fitz-James and no so sweet. M. Per___ and his wife call[ed] to communicate a discovery they had made in the Rech___ro about the (lost) predelle to our big Sassetta which contained 2 miracles of the Beato Raineri [sic]. Nice people.
Nicky read some more Boccaccio in the evening
