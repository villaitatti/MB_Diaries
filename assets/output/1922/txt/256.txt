Pleasant quiet day. Took Salvemini to Church in the evening. He was much struck by the Bay Scouts camping in our field, a dozen youngsters under a “captain” of 15[.] He said that it would be impossible in Italy because of their precocious sexuality. It explained a great deal of England’s history to him.
He told us in the evening how the fear of Hell had operated for good in his childhood.
