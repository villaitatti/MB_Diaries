—   Fine
Lizzie went in to lunch with Placci and Baron Lazzaroni came here. He brought a “Botticelli” very so ably restored that the only way you could tell it was all right was that it was somehow deadly! Ditto 2 Bart. Venetos. His “Titian” was more puzzling. If only he wouldn’t doctor up his pictures!
Took Mrs. Ross in and called on Hendersons and Kitsons (both out) and got the linen for the villino and heard Prof. Gino Bolle’s lecture on the insects hurtful to leather and books.
Chitchat. Nicky can’t bear it!
