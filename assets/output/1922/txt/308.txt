Nicky comes to stay. Delightful.              Cloudy {straddling both pages} I Tatti
Called on Sophie Serristori. Her Mother still can’t see anyone. She faints. Her heart has gone wrong. Sophie now must marry and give up the dream of loving the man she marries. Shocking to put a girl into that situation! The C__t_ thinks her son was overwhelmed by an avalanche, but really he got lost attempting a foolhardy ascent of Monte Bernina without a guide. Poor gay, vigorous Dedo, whom I’ve known from a tiny boy.
Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin (Gladys’ Uncle) came to tea, and stayed just to shake hands with B.B., who arrived with Nicky at 5, both very giù with colds and stomachs.
Eliza told me she was going to get married to that French chauffeur who has been after her (money?) so long. Poor woman! But as BB says no woman respects herself until some man has made her unhappy!
