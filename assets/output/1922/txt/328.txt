Cecil            Cloudy
Quiet day of work[.] BB is doing a new article and we as usual get fierce over the so necesary [sic] corrections of his style. Nicky rather ill, Geoffrey telephoning.
M. and Mme. René Gimpel came to dine. She is Jo Duveen’s sister, but such a little goose. She asked BB whether he had written all the books in the library!
Cecil also came, and was very nice. Nicky saw him. I think she really likes him better than she does poor silly heartbroken Geoffrey. What a miserable tangle.
Mussolini has formed a ministry with Thaon di Revel at the Marine _____ War with Jugoslavia [sic].
