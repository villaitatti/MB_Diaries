Copse Cottage
Haslemere
Came across with Barbara and [Christoph]er and found Ray with her novel practically finished. It is tremendously good. She is turning into a keen gardener. What a capable woman.
Olwin came and Simon Bussy, who is doing Barbaraâ€™s portrait and rather a horror, I fear.
{about halfway down the page} B.B. and Nicky arrive at Dresden.
