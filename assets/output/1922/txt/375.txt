Lady Leslie’s younger son, Seymour (1st Cousin of Winston Churchill) came to lunch. He is cripple, and I daresay that accounts for his somewhat aggressive manners (he is really a “Bounder”). Cecil took him to Villa Medici and Le Balze and then called for Nicky and brought her up.
We all looked at art books in the evening.
