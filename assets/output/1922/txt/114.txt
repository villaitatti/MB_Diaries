Cairo
Motored with Patricolo out to Mena House, and I rested there while the others looked at the Pyramids etc. My anti catarrh inocculation [sic] is fighting with a severe bronchial cold, and I’m rather ill. Which will win?
Later. The vaccine has won. I’m really shaking it off. We have been to dine at the Mohammed Aly club with Robin Furness, who sat silent and let us talk, a strange view of “entertainment”!
Edith writes of Philomène: “What is really fine and interesting in her is her nature, which is large, generous, incapable of pettiness or unkindness. The brain, as you perceived, struck work 10 or 15 years ago.”
