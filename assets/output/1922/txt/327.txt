Rain
Nicky came home ill with an abscess in her tooth and fever.
I took Mrs. Ross to town for errands among others interviewing a new maid. We called on Lady Enniskillen and her daughter Lady Kathleen Villiers and her daughter.
Sybil and Geoffrey and [Margaret] Strong and Lord Gerald Wellesley came to dine and Aubrey Waterfield and the tutor Mr. Wickliain. Geoffrey _____ tentatively and nervously wrote notes to Nicky, tearing up several, and I feel really sorry for Sybil. He should have done it more quickly and tactfully. He was awfully upset at her being ill. Sybil was fairly harmless, not filling the room with her voice[. Margaret] Strong begged us to advise her whether to marry Ronald Storrs or not, but how can one?
