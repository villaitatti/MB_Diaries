Raining     {straddling both pages} Big Chilling
Barbara, [Christoph]er and nurse. Dermod. Alys Logan myself
Went to B.[ritish] M.[useum] with Grace and looked round at the Egyptian things, which are less good than I expected. Emily joined us there, and we liked the Assyrian exhibit better than the Egyptian.
Lunched and shopped with Emily who finally saw me off at 5.30, in the bitter cold and rain.
