Regina Palast Munich
Went to the Alte Pinacotek and was really overwhelmed by the wealth of the collection. Those Titians! The Fra Filippo Annunciation, the Franceri, the Primitives of every school, the splendid Rubenses…. Even wretched little conceited Offner, who joined us, nor Drei the Dealer who came along, could not spoil the effect, tho[ugh] they did their best. We met Crescenzi there, and he wanted Naima’s address, but she has suffered too much from him and won’t begin again. She and BB met him when they went out for a walk, but she scarcely spoke to him. Yet she is still madly in love with him, poor dear, only afraid to put herself in a position again where he can hurt her.
