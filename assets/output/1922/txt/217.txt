Bad Kissingen
Interviewed the doctor—the usual tale, I’m fat (how fat!!) and gouty, B.B. is thin and dyspeptic. I haven’t the faith of a grain of mustard seed in the Cure! It is, du reste, very mild.
We had a huge p___, and I spent the morning writing to Jo Duveen about his mother’s death, about the Pisanello Portrait, the Maurice Hewlett “Baldovinetti” (really Pier Francesco Fiorentino) etc.
Alys wrote that little Christopher enquired “When is Gram coming home with three spades in her Magic Ear?” Barbara begins to write semi grown-up letters. Karin couldn’t stand Karersee and the exclusive company of the Amoses more than 3 days (tho[ugh] she likes Maurice), and has gone on to join Byba at Kitzebühel.
Walked about, read Countess Tolstoi’s [sic] Autobiography etc.
