Miss Paget and Young Leslie to lunch.
Mr. Colin Coote, the new Times correspondent in Rome called, a friend of Ray’s. He is a Balliol man, got into the last Parliament at 22, but failed at the last Election. He is only 27 now. We liked him, and he stayed on to dine, and met Lina Waterfield, who is the “Observer”’s Italian correspondent and her husband, who like himself had been on the Italian front. The understood eachother [sic] without saying a word!
