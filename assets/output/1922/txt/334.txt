Rain              Mrs. Cameron
Mrs. McCom
Mrs. McComb came to lunch and had a walk with B.B. while I took Mrs. Ross to town to do various shoppings, etc.
{at the bottom of the page} Mrs. Cameron arrived several hours after her telegram led us to expect. She is much better. She had been in Sicily with Josephine Griswold and the change has (really) cured her.
