Gallery in morning. It gets worse and worse. We know less than we did! Went back to Gallery.
Mme. Foucart called and Furness came to dine. We like him, though he is very silent.
The dinner was awful.
{a line beginning on the right at about ⅔ of the page leads to three smaller lines next to the facing page; the ensemble looks like a bird’s leg and seems to point to the last three paragraphs of the next page, which might therefore also belong to Mary’s recollections of the 27th}
Dr. Maclellahan, the head of the Presbyterian College here, came to lunch to talk over the Alfred Nicholson situation. He was very reasonable and nice and said he didn’t want the boy to stay if it was a misfit. Alfred came in in the evening full of his problem, poor lad, but also dying to talk poetry and books. There’s much more in him than in Jim Whitall.
Wrote G___s.
