{beginning about a sixth down the page} B.B. walked with Mrs. Lanier.
We went to the “Fledermaus” in the evening.
B.B. in Kissingen
Beyond the reach of plummet
In seas that have no sound
His heart and soul and senses
In Marcel Proust are drowned.
{at the bottom of the page} Have stopped reading Pater. It—bored us! And we used to adore it so.
