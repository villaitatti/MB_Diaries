Rosa Fitz-James and her faithful red cavalier, Comte de Laborde, came to tea, to which Leslie Hopkinson and her friend, Miss Vaughan, who lunched here, stayed on. The Hagborg ___ights and her daughter, Diane Lewis, also came to lunch, and I sent them to Villa Medici before sending the car for Miss Beit.
Geoffrey telephoned and said he was at home and begged me to come over with my party, which I did, to find the usual dreariness of Sybil’s Sunday afternoons.
Teig___, Denman Ross’ friend, came to tea and stayed to dine. He talked mysteriously of “modes” exactly like Denman, and i suspect he is wasting his time and energy experimenting in “modes” and “methods[.]” He is a feeble youth.
