Zangwills        Rain and scirocco
Took Zangwills down, and I called on Bardini to see the things he wants to sell to the Duveens.
Baron von Hadeln came to lunch, without adding any joy to the occasion.
I took the Zangwills to call on Miss Pagel, who was most brilliant. Miss Mabel Price also was there.
A trying dinner-party, with the Ojettis and Mrs. Ross and Confusion of Tongues. I was really bored till I was frightened about my mental condition.
Read Zangwill on Zionism aloud to B.B.
