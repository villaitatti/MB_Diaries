Cairo
Finer but very warm
Museum, partly with Quibell. He let me hold Akenaten’s skull in my hand!!
Creswell and Mrs. Devonshire came to lunch and Maurice—Sir Maurice—Amos called.
Museum again after going to the Mosque of Sinan Pascha at Boulak with Cresswell. Turkish {scratched} 157 {scratched} with surrounding porch like the one op[posite] El Azar. Dome rather spoilt by gallery and pendentive supports breaking the upward sweep.
Tea with the Bazils to meet Mr. Paterson, and then out to Gesireh in the Amos (Gov’t) motor to have a chat with them.
Mr. Truman and Major Anderson came to dine and were pleasant[.] Talked about the skull sutures closing up years earlier in Asiatics than Europeans.
Wrote dozens of bed notes.
