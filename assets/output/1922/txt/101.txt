They stand on an equality with their gods, they trample on their enemies, they stride and brandish mighty weapons {added above, they consume endless feasts and count uncountable _____}, at their most moral they deny before the Judge of the underworld having done anything wrong and demand as their due all the material delights of the other world. No doubt of the completeness and sufficiency of life seems to have crossed their mind {above, casts a shadow on _____ art}. It is all triumphant, cruel, self-assertive, materialistic, magnificent. Seeing it electrifies one’s nerves. Of course I didn’t believe _____ the beginning of it. Man is a corruptible worm, and his life is full of sadness and failure. All the same, it elates me to find that human beings once asserted, proudly and mendaciously, the opposite. No art has ever thrilled me like this. {written on the left margin perpendicular to the main text} As for BB., he is stricken dumb, I can’t get a word out of him. He has no nice little formulae to meet this overwhelming experience, and he says he feels as if he [could] never open his mouth again to emit a feeble _____ on the subject of Art!”
