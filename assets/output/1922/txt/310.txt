Fine
Scores of letters all morning. Pollak and Brauer called on B.B. and he paid back what Brauer lent him so that now we are without a debt, Karin’s £1100 having been paid off in Sept[ember] and Cannon’s £4000 quite a long time ago. I went to see Mrs. Ross, and came to find De Nicola here with a small Fra Angelico for sale. They ask £4000!!! Lady Lister-Kaye and her sister, the Dowager Duchess of Manchester, with her daughter of 14, Lady Louisa Montagu came to tea.
Read Stanley Hall’s “Senescence” and gleaned a few limits for my own.
Read “Big Peter” by A. Marshall[,] a very mechanical novel. Why on earth is it so popular? But I am an oldster evidently.
