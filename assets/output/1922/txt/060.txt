Down the river to Shellal
Stopped at the really lovely little Temple of Kalabsha. Divine reliefs of Isis suckling the King, her movement tender and beautiful. Reliefs of animal tributeâ€”giraffes, ostriches, lions, tigers, monkeys etc.
What motives!!
Colour well preserved in parts.
Bought a nose-ring for Barbara.
