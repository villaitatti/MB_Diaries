Cold worse         
So so day
Nicky arrived at 5.30 a.m! dear creature! B.B. and I went to the Museum and then to the French Institute for lunch w. Storrs. We came back and took Nicky a drive along the native streets. She entered into the spirit of it.
Then B.B. and I went to Lady Allenby’s musical. Mme. de Cramer
 played gloriously—a great artist. We met the Mackintoshes, Elgoods, Sérionnes, Russells, Storrs, Creswell, Mme. Foucart, and various then new acquaintances.
Mrs. De Kaven writes “I am well and for the moment restored to the normal-by companionship [Spender] I shall never be free from suffering without it. I have lived the life à deux too long. A cultivated mind—a keenly sensitive responsiveness (aha?)—a high and very faithful idea of friendship provide very reliable foundations for just the sort of companionship wh. I fancy is bad for me at this time of the day.”
