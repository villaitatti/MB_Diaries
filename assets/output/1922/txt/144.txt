Logan           I {continued on the facing page}
Naimi
Got up for lunch with the Salveminis. Usual thing, he lovable, she heavy and embarrassing.
Went with Logan to call at Villa Medici in order that no trouble should arise—though I wish them thousands of miles away. But B. B. has been very bearish and rude. Geoffrey seemed in a cage, it is very painful to see him there.
Brought back the Archibald Russells, and Col. L___rs and Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick Owen (16 Princes Gardens SW. 7) came to tea. All boring.
Ammannati came up, revealing vast expenses.
Finished Simkovitch’s “Towards the Understand of [Christ]”, with better essays on the Decline of Rome and Hay and Villages
Wrote to Princess Bassiano, Philomène S. Dorotea, Lucca
