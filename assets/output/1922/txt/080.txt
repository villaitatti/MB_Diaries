Luxor
Patricolo
Karnac in the morning: very hot but getting more interesting each time.
Patricolo left at 3. A very nice man.
Dr. Young (Hugh) Logan’s Dr., arrived and in 5 minutes was drawing me pictures of Logan’s bladder, urethra and prostate, to illustrate the operation he did on him at the Johns Hopkins.
Karnac at sunset walking round on the wall, and riding back by the river.
