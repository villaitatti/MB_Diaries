Frankfürter Hof
Called on Mrs. Dumont, then spent morning at Städelinstitut looking among other things at the Italian drawings.
Sacred are the Vermeer, the small Raphael Titian portrait, the B. Veneto Courtesan, the Palma nude women, the Vermeer architect, the M. Caravaggio Bacchus and the Maître de Flémalle Crucifixion.
Lunched with Dumonts, Schwarz___ and Prince Richard of Hesse {quotation marks, probably referring to “Schwarz___,” which is immediately above} took us to Wiesbaden to see the Hänkels’ pictures. Very nice people. Also to Hirsch’s house in Frankfort, with pictures, books, objets d’art, furniture, carpets and cheerlessness.
Dined and talked with Dumonts.
