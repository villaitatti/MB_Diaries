Assuan
Saw Comombo, a wonderful “location” as the Western lady called it, and very picturesque, even grand.
This same individual asked Nicky if the 80 odd donkeys that meet us at the landings to carry us to the Temples were different local donkeys, and whether they followed us from Cairo in a boat!!!
Visited Island of Elephantine.
