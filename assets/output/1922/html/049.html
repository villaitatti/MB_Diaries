		<p>Early start to the Tombs of the Kings and various temples, and Tombs of Nobles. We are saved! Thereâ€™s no need to go back on Italian art on account of this. All the ptgs. were what we shd. call 5th rate in Italy. Their art seems to have declined from the Early Dynasties. Even the famous XVIII is not very good. We are debased enough to like it better in the Ptolemaic time, when it acquires an almost French XVIII grace and neatness.</p>
