		<p>Mrs. Carrol and Miss Perkins came to tea.</p>
		<p>Karin and Geoffrey went to Villa Medici and Le Balze, B.B. and the Perrys and Naima leaving them there while they went on “the Drive,” round behind Monte Senario.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey read me Blake’s poetry; some I scarcely knew. He went away after dinner, leaving me with a sense of his hopeless misery. And he is very hard to bear in a hundred ways, alas.</p>
