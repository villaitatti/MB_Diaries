		<p>Winter {continued on facing page}</p>
		<p>All day steaming down. Sunset beautiful. Became more friendly with people on leaving. The Willocks for Baltimore, the Weeds for Long Island, Sanderson Tom Wahrlichâ€™s friend Mrs. Donald for Washington State, etc.</p>
		<p>First saw the Temples at Kalapsha and I bought an authentic nose-ring for Barbara from a little black girl just her age.</p>
		<p>Arrived Luxor at night.</p>
