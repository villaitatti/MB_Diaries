		<p>CavourMilan     Downpour</p>
		<p>Motored in with Guido and found Nicky (with a fierce cold) waiting for us. Spent the day fruitlessly seeing Sig. Chiesa’s horrible collection of rubbish in which the few tolerable things were suffocated. Saw Guido’s things, which were better. Met Riri Visconti-Venosta and “Castonaso” (Galavresi) at the hotel. Eliza and I took the night train for Florence.</p>
