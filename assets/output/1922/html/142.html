		<p>This is Wednesday the 26th. I got up to lunch. Mrs. Emmett and daughter, M___ Henry Parkman and daughter, Edmund Houghton and niece all came to tea—a desperate party, with {scratched} many flappers!</p>
		<p>I have a most horrible nauseating feeling as if all these people were flies with their feet sticking to fly-paper, buzzing, buzzing—I don’t know what to do.</p>
		<p>Mr. and Mrs. Archibald Russell came to lunch, and they and Logan and M___ H___t called at Villa Medici, where Sybil was hopping about like a grasshopper and making a continuous noise. She is worse than ever!</p>
		<p>{2 skipped lines}</p>
		<p>Wrote to Whitall and Eliza Nicholson telling they must give their son $5000 a year, and wrote to him also. Wrote to Miss Franklin and a lady gardener</p>
