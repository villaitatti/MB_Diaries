		<p>Glorious</p>
		<p>Went to town with Mrs. Ross and accomplished all my errands—a thing I never could do before Kissingen! Brought up Leslie Hopkinson and her Cambridge (Mass) friend, Miss Vaughan, to lunch. Afterwards when we asked Nicky what impression they made on her, she said “None”. She added— “There are some American women who seem to belong to a sex we don’t have in Europe”.</p>
		<p>Later B.B. called on Sybil, Nicky on Iris and I on Strong. Ronald Storrs gave Margaret </p>
		<p>Strong a glorious Season in London, as all his swell friends were in the plot to get her with her money for him. In the end she refused him. The little donkey asked Sybil “Do you think he knows who my Grandfather [Rockefeller!!] is?”</p>
		<p>Sybil’s face looked very sweet. I have never seen her so nice! She spoke quite calmly to B.B. about her marriage being a failure, yet affectionately of Geoffrey.</p>
		<p>{vertically along the page’s left margin} Looked at Romanesque sculpture (German and It.[alian]) photos in evening, those sent by Ha_a__</p>
