		<p>Gazzada</p>
		<p>Crossed the 2 frontiers without incident and got to Como in time to see Sant’Abbondio (on the whole, disappointing). Lunched at Villa d’Este. Came on here by way of Castiglione d’Olona where we saw again the heavenly frescoes of Masolino. Got here for tea and a stroll in the park. Anita is better than we expected. She is a sweet thing. Her daughter is here with her little daughter of 9, Julia. She was Signora Mantegazza, but got a divorce at Fiume and is now g___g to many a young Neapolitan.</p>
