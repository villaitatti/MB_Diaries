		<p>Rain              Mrs. Cameron</p>
		<p>Mrs. McCom</p>
		<p>Mrs. McComb came to lunch and had a walk with B.B. while I took Mrs. Ross to town to do various shoppings, etc.</p>
		<p>{at the bottom of the page} Mrs. Cameron arrived several hours after her telegram led us to expect. She is much better. She had been in Sicily with Josephine Griswold and the change has (really) cured her.</p>
