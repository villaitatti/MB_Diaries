		<p>Abu Simbel—</p>
		<p>There are no words!</p>
		<p>On each side of the great sculptured rock façade pans out a red-gold cataract of sand. Towards sunset we climbed to the top for the unforgettable sunset view. I sat on the sand and slid down, sand and all, without a line of drapery being disarrayed. B.B. said “I am here to look, not to play” and thumped painfully down along the moraine of rocks at the side.</p>
		<p>The whole thing’s incredible!!</p>
		<p>The “petrified love story”, [sic], as Wahrlich called it, Rameses’ Temple for Nefertari, is also very grand. The great figures seem to be marching out of the mountain.</p>
		<p>The scenery is past imagining. Hundreds of natural but marvellously [sic] symmetrical pyramids are scattered over the golden sand of the desert.</p>
