		<p>Chelsea.</p>
		<p>Val Washington’s</p>
		<p>5 children (including Dermod)house</p>
		<p>Went to London taking Salvemini and Karin’s children to go to Firth Hendersons’. S.[alvemini] was jiggered to realize that one simply puts one’s luggage in the van, with no receipt! Not necessarily locked, either.</p>
		<p>Shopped with Grace. It turns out that the Italian P.O. has sent word that it cannot accept registered letters any more! What an unheard-of state of anarchy!!</p>
		<p>Called on Saidee, who turns out to have gravel in the kidneys. She is a bore, poor thing, but _____ get to head the sound of “Peg” (“Paig”)!! Very nice chat with Grace and Val in the evening. He is developing and has lost his _____ shyness.</p>
		<p>Went to N.[ational] G.[allery] and liked, on the whole, the arrangement of the pictures.</p>
