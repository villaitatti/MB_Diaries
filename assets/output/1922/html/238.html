		<p>Frankfort</p>
		<p>Spent the morning at the Städelinstitut bringing the Director, Herr Swarzenski, back to lunch with the Dumarts at the Frankfürter Hof.</p>
		<p>Ordered same wine, as it is very good and amazingly cheap there.</p>
		<p>Motored home over Orb, but lost our way again for a bit. It was a less lovely drive than yesterday’s by the river.</p>
		<p>Stopped at Gellenhausen and saw the Cathedral, with fine glass and statues by Riemenschneider.</p>
		<p>I read aloud one of Geo.[rge] Moore’s stories in the new vol.[ume] {scratched}. Very flat and Chinese-y, but how well written.</p>
