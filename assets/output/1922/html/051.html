		<p>Esne [sic] and Edfu</p>
		<p>Saw Esna and Edfu. The Abbé St. Paul Girard who is excavating at Edfu, took us to see where he is digging. A cut had been made in the mound _____ on the top, the modern mud houses, then the Copt (some of teal brick), then 2 strata of Arab towns, then Greek. He had not yet got down to the level of the Temple, where he hoped to find Egyptian remains.</p>
		<p>Edfu is the best preserved, but it somehow left us cold, like St. Owen, you _____ it off. But the capitals are glorious, and of course it is impressive.</p>
		<p>Read Reisner’s Gifford lecture on the Egyptian view of Immortality—apparently, from all the authorities, a materialistic, matter-of-fact affair, but dangerous, needing rites and offerings and magical words to get you safely along. We have yet to find the first trace of the spiritual in it.</p>
