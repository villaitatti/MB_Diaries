		<p>Luxor</p>
		<p>Had lunch with Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter at their delightful house near the Cooks’ Rest House. The inside is just the brown mud, and is like undressed brown suède, it is a colour flies don’t care for.</p>
		<p>They neither of them believed in Moussa, the snake-charmer.</p>
		<p>B.B. had a long discussion with Carter about the origin of the Egyptians. He thinks they came from the far south.</p>
