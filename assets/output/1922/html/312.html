		<p>Dull and cold and heavy              Naimi</p>
		<p>The Duchess of Manchester and her daughter and Lady Lister-Kaye and Byba came to lunch. It was indeed very dull.</p>
		<p>Miss Halsey called at 4, no less boring, and I walked with her to Mrs. Ross.</p>
		<p>Have asked Gnoli to spend next Sunday here—with Naimi! How I hope he will end by marrying her. But I fear she will somehow spoil it.</p>
		<p>Logan writes: “Trevy was here yesterday—he is much amazed that you will be away from Florence in Feb[ruary], as he says it upsets his plans. I am afraid you didn’t think of this when you decided to go to Greece! He spent a long time discussing where he should stay in Florence when he does out, and somehow put the blame on me for your not being there to take him in. I came in the end most apologetic about it!”</p>
