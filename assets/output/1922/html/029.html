		<p>Thursday, January 5, 1922</p>
		<p>Fine day</p>
		<p>Still in bed with bronchitis.</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky went to {scratched} Hassan with the Residency party and then Mrs. D[evonshire] muddled away the rest of the morning stupidly.</p>
		<p>Logan has called he {scratched} canâ€™t come. I am awfully disappointed. He is slower in getting over his operation than they thought.</p>
		<p>B.B. and N. went to Creswell, and then B.B. called in the Countess of Villamarina.</p>
