		<p>Hotel zum SternAnsbach—</p>
		<p>Stopped in morning and had a last gorge at lunch. What food—!!! But it fattens me up too much, and makes Naima ill. B.B. had a glorious time with the pictures, while we bought his glasses, cigarettes, etc. Also, I must add, some things for ourselves. We feel that N.[aima] does such a lot for us that we must pay her more than her normal fees. And I gave her 20000 marks (only about £8.10 really) to get some clothes on her way home in September. The mark has fallen from 2300 a £1 sterling on Saturday to 2470 today. No wonder the shopkeepers feel indifferent about selling their goods which were purchased before the extremity of the present débacle. Poor people!</p>
		<p>We meant to go to Nürnberg, but came to Ansbach instead, in memory of Cecil’s and my visit her before the war.</p>
