		<p>All this was the 23rd</p>
		<p>Still in bed, threatened with jaundice. Judge Wells and Placci came to lunch, and stayed on to tea. Placci came in to see and talked and talked, well justifying his mother’s name for him of Ministero degli Affari Inutili.</p>
		<p>Aunt Janet and Charley Bell came to dinner, and both spent ½ hour with me.</p>
		<p>I was overcome by a horrible feeling that these people we have come back to are only flies, with their feet stuck to fly-paper, buzzing—buzzing—I buzz too, what else is there?—but my interest is no longer there. I’m still looking at Egyptian reproductions and reading. So simple to feel sure that the next life is only Everlasting Eternal Eating.</p>
