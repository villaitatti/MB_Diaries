		<p> {straddling both pages} Kissingen</p>
		<p>The day passed (after baths, etc) in an excursion to Würzburg, where B.B. and I were carried away by Tiepolo’s gorgeous decorative frescoes over the great staircase, and also in the mirror room. What brio! What colour! What composition! What movement!</p>
		<p>Nicky couldn’t like them—of course it’s too big a jump for her to take from Romanesque and Egyptian art. She must train her muscles a bit before such a leap.</p>
		<p>We liked the Riemenschneiders also, and found the Cathedral in execrable taste, but still amusing.</p>
		<p>We quarreled about the Schloss garden, which Nicky and I thought to [sic] stuffed with unmethodical planning, too “giardino inglese” and B.B. adored. He got quite hairy. But of course we were right!</p>
		<p>Nicky read aloud Lytton Strachey on Voltaire in England, much the best of his essays in the new book.</p>
