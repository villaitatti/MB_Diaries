		<p>Mrs. Igler and Mr. Harris came to lunch. Nicky recognized the Maestro di Scuole type at once. I had a walk in morning with our guests, and B.B. and Harris in the afternoon aft took them to Gamberaia while I went to bed with a bronchitis got from the “pure icy wind” on Vallombrosa. B.B. is a bit cough-y too. Evidently we are no longer young enough to stand those rough changes!</p>
		<p>The von Harrachs came to dine. He seems improved by his won experiences and she remains the original dear she always was. I saw only her, as I was in bed.</p>
