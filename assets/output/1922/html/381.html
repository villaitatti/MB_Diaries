		<p>Rainy</p>
		<p>A very dank damp day. B.B. would not go out to walk, but Bessie and I called on Aunt Janet.</p>
		<p>Have finished the “Prinz der D[”] by Manolescu—I am really getting on with reading German</p>
		<p>{4 skipped lines}</p>
		<p>{last page’s line leads to this passage} Hutch and Neith and Miriam came to dinner. I am in a horrid mood, and their tales of drunken bouts, etc. filled me with real disgust, and his book “The Story of a Lover” seems to me disgusting Exhibitionism, in spite of its depth and sincerity.</p>
