		<p>The sub-Mudir took a lot of us to a garden, where we saw the snake-charmer catch 2 scorpions, 2 cobras and another snake. Very fascinating. He is extremely agile and escapes the cobraâ€™s bite with ease, letting it spit its venom till all is gone and it is tired, and then he easily takes it up and puts it in his basket.</p>
