		<p>{beginning about a sixth down the page} B.B. walked with Mrs. Lanier.</p>
		<p>We went to the “Fledermaus” in the evening.</p>
		<p>B.B. in Kissingen</p>
		<p>Beyond the reach of plummet</p>
		<p>In seas that have no sound</p>
		<p>His heart and soul and senses</p>
		<p>In Marcel Proust are drowned.</p>
		<p>{at the bottom of the page} Have stopped reading Pater. It—bored us! And we used to adore it so.</p>
