		<p>Pyramids—Cairo</p>
		<p>I wrote to Geoffrey today about Philomène</p>
		<p>“She made her great bid for freedom by running away with a young married man, whom when their child was born, she discovered to be “a mere biological factor”. Having done this, she feels perfectly assured that she thinks for herself, and she regards all the neo-Catholic, ultra St. Germain, Jesuitical prison (distilled in part by our good Abbé Meunier) which she has, alas, only too well assimilated, as self-generated and mysteriously significant. She’s not a bit interested in things, only in herself and the suggestions of mystery and romance that certain picturesquenesses araise [sic] in her.</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky rode on donkeys to the Temple of the Sun ({scratched} 1½ hours each way). I stayed in to write letters, mostly business. Wrote to Mr. Cannon.</p>
		<p>Walked out with Lady Kitson to explore tombs and found 2 beauties excavated by the French 1916 _i__e of Kephren. Tea with amusing Mrs. Kirkwood in her lovely house under the Great Pyramid. Motored here. Patricolo to dine.</p>
