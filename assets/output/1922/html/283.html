		<p>B.B. and I saw th Went with Valentiner to the Schloss where they have the Kunstgewerbe museum now. Were taken, much against B.B.’s will to Dr. Bode’s room to see the Watteaus and Himself. He was pointedly rude, barely saluted us and rushed off. I had a look round the pictures. They think they have a new Piero della Francesca—it is a _____ copy. Valentiner seems very nice.</p>
		<p>I took Karin and Adrian in the motor out to the Wannsee to have tea. They were most agreeable.</p>
		<p>Went to Così fan Tutti in the evening, deliciously gay and pretty.</p>
