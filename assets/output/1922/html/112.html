		<p>Cairo</p>
		<p>Finer but very warm</p>
		<p>Museum, partly with Quibell. He let me hold Akenaten’s skull in my hand!!</p>
		<p>Creswell and Mrs. Devonshire came to lunch and Maurice—Sir Maurice—Amos called.</p>
		<p>Museum again after going to the Mosque of Sinan Pascha at Boulak with Cresswell. Turkish {scratched} 157 {scratched} with surrounding porch like the one op[posite] El Azar. Dome rather spoilt by gallery and pendentive supports breaking the upward sweep.</p>
		<p>Tea with the Bazils to meet Mr. Paterson, and then out to Gesireh in the Amos (Gov’t) motor to have a chat with them.</p>
		<p>Mr. Truman and Major Anderson came to dine and were pleasant[.] Talked about the skull sutures closing up years earlier in Asiatics than Europeans.</p>
		<p>Wrote dozens of bed notes.</p>
