		<p>Perrys</p>
		<p>Still in bed.</p>
		<p>Mme. Salvemini and her daughter came to lunch and of course spent the day, but I scarcely saw her. She tires me awfully.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey and Karin dined at the Villino, and I think G.[eoffrey] had a walk with Nicky in the afternoon, but she gets further and further away from her poor despairing _____.</p>
		<p>Mrs. de Kaven came to dine, as idiotic about Spender and as full of herself as ever. I scarcely saw her, I felt too ill, but it was partly loathing.</p>
