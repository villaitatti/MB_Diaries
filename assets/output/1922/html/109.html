		<p>Khamseen or Scirocco. Very bad.</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky went to see the collection of _____, but I stayed in to write. At 3 Patricolo came and took us to the Mosque and Tomb of Kalaun, with its mediaeval façad[e]s, resembling, he said, S. Simeon in N. Syria. The interior effect recalls San Vitale at Ravenna. There is some lovely inlay work. It is the most impressive of the Tombs. Then we went to El Azar, but it was only half full, and no lecturers seated low up[on] pillars with circles of students of all ages from 18 up squatted around. It isn’t safe to go any more in the ___gs. Saw also the Turkish Mosque of c. 1780 just opposite, with very European loggia all round, like late Renaissance work. The cupola is large and low and seems to crush down instead of soar.</p>
		<p>Went on to the Countess Villamarina’s, met G— Adamoli, the Kramers, Anderson etc.</p>
		<p>Philomène left for Jerusalem.</p>
		<p>Wrote to Storrs, Sulley, Jim Whitall, Bain, Geoffrey, all the grandchildren and Alys, Somers Clarke, Ray, Barbara.</p>
