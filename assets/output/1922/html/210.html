		<p>July 4. Saw Verona, especially San Zeno and the Baptistery and we had forgotten the almost classic Byzantine font—and motored to</p>

		<p>Karin arrived at 10 and we motored her to join the Amoses at the Karersee. The bridge was broken, so we had to go round—90 km. instead of 28—but it was really worth it for the glorious view of those incredible Dolomites, which can be fully seen only by the road we took. Predazzo, Moena etc. Unfortunately B.B. gave out (thro[ugh] hunger) and behaved like a ridiculous spoilt child, very cross and unreasonable—such an exhibition of folly and lack of self-control and determination to make the worst of everything, that any pleasure was entirely spoilt. It takes me hours and hours to get over such exhibitions. We found the Amos family there, but no one else, and K.[arin] felt {here the text bends and becomes vertical along the page’s right margin} very déçue, poor child, for she longs for society and fun. {vertically along the page’s left margin} Met Ashburner and talked about Spender’s being kicked out of the “British Institute”</p>
