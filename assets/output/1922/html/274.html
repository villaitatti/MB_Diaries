		<p>Nice day at last</p>
		<p>Shopped. Went to see Logan who is still in bed, with a catheter, trying to get his incision wound to heal.</p>
		<p>Britten lunched with me at Verry’s—and complained of our neglect: but he has never taken any trouble to make himself acceptable. Poor old man.</p>
		<p>Jim Whitall called on me and made a very nice impression. He is maturing unexpectedly well.</p>
