		<p>Misty           cold        {straddling both pages} Eugénie Strong</p>
		<p>{scratched} fine</p>
		<p>The horrors of dressmaking occupied my morning. Walked with B.B. on hills.</p>
		<p>Nicky lunched dined with Cecil and went to see some Sicilian actors.</p>
		<p>Ray wrote saying she wanted to go to America for 6 weeks and asked B.B. to advance her allowance. It seems a wildcat scheme and I’m so sure he will resent the request that my heart is as heavy as lead. She is certainly not careful about money, and wants to get all she can out of us. I sympathize only too keenly with this. But Alys and Logan think she is wrong, and I am no judge where the “fun” of my children is concerned.</p>
		<p>Herr and Frau Hammer (Austrians) came to lunch—nice people, as keen as snuff on art.</p>
