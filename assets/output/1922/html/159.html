		<p>Villino Medici with Logan</p>
		<p>Weather overcast, but clearing up towards sunset. Logan and I walked to the view over Reg___ the Val d’Arno Superiore, and it was beautiful. My first walk in 5 weeks. Felt better than I should have expected as my temperature varied during the day from 35—38.5!</p>
