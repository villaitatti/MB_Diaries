		<p>Rain   {straddling both pages} Alys</p>
		<p>Bessie</p>
		<p>Lovely quiet [morning] of work—I hardly ever get it.</p>
		<p>We called on [Margaret] Strong, but B.B. lost his temper and [would] not go in. Bessie says he has exactly his father’s bad temper, so I suppose he can’t help it, but it is degrading and sordid, and I cannot get used to it, not after more than 30 years!!! It is idiotic of me. The poor things [sic] insides are all upset, that is the cause of his hereditary temper coming out.</p>
		<p>We had the chance (he having walked home in a sulk) to call on the Polkinghames and Aunt Janet.</p>
		<p>Pleasant evening looking at books</p>
