		<p>Frankfürter Hof   Frankfurt a/M Rain</p>
		<p>Motored here, stopping in the inevitable rain to lunch at Aschaffenbach and see the Palace. Nothing worth seeing, really, but we sent for the Librarian, for we wanted to see the “Purple” Bible and the XII [manuscript]. He came furious and fierce and disobliging, but thawed and melted utterly as he saw that B. B. really knew what he was looking at, and was ein echte Gelehrte. Then he apologized for his Grobheit. We promised to send him some books for his English courses at the University. He has 1000 marks a year to spend on books—about 5!</p>
		<p>Saw a fine Tintoretto belonging to the Wolfs Dined at Frankfurt with Nicky’s friends Mr. and Mrs. (geb. von Flotow) Kesler[.] She talks continuously. There was no point in meeting them, except niceness to Nicky.</p>
