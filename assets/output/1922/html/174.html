		<p>Ralph talked with me about Karin’s book. He is a “realist” and believes in “Time” aside from memory. He objects to Bergson’s use of the term mind or he thinks B.[ergson] knows too little about it from the physiological or psychological point of view. It is indeed rather arbitrary to say that “the brain” is useful for forgetting, when in the same sense it is “the brain” which remembers. Ralph thought K[arin]’s explan exposition very clear and able.</p>
