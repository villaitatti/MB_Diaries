		<p>Stayed in for letters and the doctor at 11. Began diathermy for my knees. Heard of new cancer cure practised by him invented by Dr. Russ and Dr. Lazarus Barlow at the Cancer Research Hospital of London. Vaccination with vaccine made from the patientâ€™s cancer. Also the operation with diathermy for bleeding. What a discovery.</p>
		<p>Mr. E. Thomas came to lunch, just engaged to a girl named Marjorie Da___.</p>
		<p>Count Galazza dined with us, a Spaniard dressed like a Goya, with a red curled wig[,] a stock, a frock coat and black velvet waistcoat. He teaches Arab literature and philosophy here, but is more a Yogi than anything else, except, possibly, a fraud. He is said to have fought with the Devil at the Pyramid and lost 2 fingers of his left hand on which he always keeps a black glove.</p>
