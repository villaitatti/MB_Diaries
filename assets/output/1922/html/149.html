		<p>Logan</p>
		<p>Lady Irene</p>
		<p>Storrs lunched at Villa Medici and called on the Strongs. Logan and Lady Irene picked him up there, along with Alberto Ball who lunched with us. Logan said Storrs was certainly making up to [Margaret] Strong. I suppose he feels determined to make a side marriage.</p>
		<p>Mrs. ___ter and her daughter called. Also André Germain and his awful friend. A day of horror, for even Ball was awful.</p>
		<p>They all went to K___z’s concert, and Ray read Logan and BB and me her Novel.</p>
