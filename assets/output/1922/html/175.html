		<p>In bed</p>
		<p>A day of frightful pain. I begin to think of killing myself if it goes on. It just cannot be endured. I ended with drugs, but it was not till 2.30 a. m. that I got relief.</p>
		<p>Mr. Vanderlip fresh from Genoa dined here, with his son and two friends named Allen. Also Mrs. Ross and the Lindsays from India. I saw Mrs. Ross an instant.</p>
