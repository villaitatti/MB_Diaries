		<p>Philomène, Nicky, Gen. Kitson and I went on donkeys Camels to Abusir and Sakkara, and met B.B. and Lady Kitson and Mr. Dunham, who drove them there in his Ford, at Mariette’s house, where we lunched.</p>
		<p>We re-saw the Tombs of Ptah-hotep and Ti, and they were less vital in handling than we had been thinking. All the same one feels a very strong current of life and invention still running, which in the later things ceased, though the invention was great enough to carry the art unchanged and yet beau grand and beautiful through thousands of years.</p>
