		<p>Spent morning watching Ray put the unsinkable Ford boat together, which in the afternoon we took to the sea and let the [children] paddle about in it.</p>
		<p>News came that Dedo Serristori was killed by an avalanche climbing a [mountain] near the St_l__ro. His poor mother! I cannot imagine how she will bear it. It is an atrocious tragedy. I wrote to herâ€”but what is there to say?</p>
