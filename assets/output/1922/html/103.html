		<p>House, Pyramids</p>
		<p>B.B. Nicky and I explored the rock Tombs below the pyramids and the granite Temple, and gazed long at the Sphinx.</p>
		<p>Mr. and Mrs. Dunham, of the Harvard Exploration Mission, lunched with us, and afterwards took us to see their excavations among the Tombs of the III and IV dynasty, {scratched} behind and beside the Pyramids, and then on to tea at their house on top of the hill, with the grandest view imaginable. Miss Kitson and Lady Kitson came with us. Capt. Cresswell [sic] bounded up when we returned, full of excitement about his beloved squinches, and stayed to dinner.</p>
