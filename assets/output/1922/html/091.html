		<p>Went to the Ramosi tomb and its twin one Ka-en-Heh, the best in Luxor. What lovely reliefs! As fine in line as Desiderio, as amusing as Benozzo, as taking as Agostino da [sic] Duccio, and as grand as Donatello!</p>
		<p>Lunched with the Winlocks. He seems more friendly.</p>
		<p>Went to Karnac for sunset and early moonlight, and had some chat with M. Pillé [sic], the architect in chief.</p>
		<p>Wrote to Gen. Storrs that we weren’t coming to Jerusalem. Wrote to Patricolo, Alban, Geoffrey, Mrs. Ross.</p>
