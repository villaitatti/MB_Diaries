		<p>Hotel Riva San Lorenzo Verona</p>
		<p>This was Monday!</p>
		<p>Left Bologna at 9 and saw Modena from 10.30—12. The sculpture by Villamin on the Cathedral façade is remarkable, though after the lovely lithe Egyptian forms that still fill my imagination, it is hard to accept the crude, unproportioned, ugly canon of the mediaeval master. Of Egyptian sculpture he has only _____ huge feet! The work inside is by another hand. Both N.[orth] and S.[outh] portals are lovely. At the Pinacoteca we saw some interesting pictures (it’s been ages since we were there) but the two masterpieces, the Dosso “Fool” and the Velasquez portrait, are covered with irregular glass and you can’t see them!! Human folly.</p>
		<p>At Mantua they are busy faking rooms, while the Mantegna frescoes are flaking off in big pieces. Human folly again</p>
		<p>B.B. went sightseeing here, too, but I rested. He saw San Zeno.</p>
		<p>I recall arriving here from Munich with Geoffrey and being overcome with fatigue, but reviving with San Zeno.</p>
