		<p>THE DIARY OF MARY BERENSON</p>
		<p>1922</p>
		<p>transcribed from the diary preserved in the Archive at Villa I Tatti</p>
		<p>June – July 2017</p>
		<p>The diary contains 412 pages. Berenson’s annotations begin on the first dated page. </p>
		<p>Sunday, January 1, 1922, Cairo</p>
		<p>Bronchial cold.</p>
		<p>Shepheards’ [sic] Hotel. Cloudy</p>
		<p>Simaika Pasha called for us at 9.30, and Mrs. (Labouchere) Mackintosh, and we drove around and picked up Col. Storrs (The Governor of Jerusalem!!) and went out to the delightful Coptic Museum, where we spent 2 hours. The early carved wooden door and a ditto screen were particularly interesting. Saw the Roman gate, now far below the level of the town which certainly rises incredibly! I suppose they are too lazy to burn their rubbish.</p>
		<p>On the way Storrs told the Pasha, who is the head of the Copts, about the Holy Sepulchre rows. An immemorial custom grants free access to walk round the Tank to everyone, but the Copts have a Chapel on the back and 3 times a wk. for 2 hrs. They spread out and fill up the passage. The Franciscans, to assert the old custom, make a point of sending servants carrying food for some nuns right through the crowd of worshipping Copts, who retaliate by throwing water on the “Way to the t” ? where the Catholic procession has to haul!!</p>
		<p>Stopped at the desolate romantic mosque of Amr.</p>
		<p>Sent poor Eliza to the hospital. They think she has typhoid. Went to electrical doctor.</p>
