		<p>Hotel Creid. Innsbruck</p>
		<p>Lovely drive till we reached the Italian frontier, where our troubles began and lasted 3 hours and more, what with muddle and incompetence. Useless to go into it! We did not reach Innsbruck till 6.30, in a wild windstorm. But it is a beautiful road.</p>
		<p>My room costs 16000 kronen, with a surtax of 6000/22000, but that is nothing to our dinners which came to 30100 kronen!! The hotel-keeper says they live on the very verge of complete bankruptcy. This hotel is fearfully run down, no new paint, everything shabby. A plate of ham cost 3000!</p>
		<p>Poor people.</p>
