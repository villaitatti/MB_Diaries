		<p>Museum and again Mr. Quibell came around with us. B.B. says he feels like “Peeping Tom”, just looking through a small crack at Egyptian Art!</p>
		<p>Patricolo came to lunch and took us to the Sheik —’s house, where the lighting is so lovely in the big upstairs room. Also to another, but _____ house, also beautiful, but lacking the garden.</p>
		<p>B.B. and I dined at the Amos’ where Maurice (Sir Maurice!) disported himself conversationally like a playful whale. Lucy grows on acquaintance. I understand why they are more popular among our kind of people than the Elgoods. They promote conversation, and Per kills it.</p>
		<p>The girls went out to the prostitutes’ quarters with Truman, but failed to find the Mille Nuits. The boys were much more attractive than the women</p>
