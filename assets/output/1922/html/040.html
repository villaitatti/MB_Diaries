		<p>Packing!! Eliza got back from Hospital only at 3. Nicky has been an Angel of helpfulness. “Things love” her, and they seemed to fly into their places. BB’s only contribution was—“I don’t like to see you using my sponge to wet the labels”!</p>
		<p>We lunched with Mr. and Mrs. William Whiting Andrews (chargé d’affaires at the American Ministry here) and then I called on Mme. Foucart, wrote my name in the Sultana’s book. Called on Mme. de Sérionne, Mme. Neguib Pasha, Mrs. Dousan, Mrs. Graham. I liked the Dousans very much.</p>
		<p>Whitall and Eliza Nicholson and their son Alfred (whom I’m trying to save from being a sort of missionary and send to Cambridge), Capitain de Cards (Liaison officer between Allenby and Gouraud), Patricolo, Mrs. de Kaven and Mr. Spender called.</p>
