		<p>Chilling  Rain</p>
		<p>Arrived in London at 9.30 a.m. but by a muddle of Ray’s (she mistook the day) neither she nor Barbara were there to meet me.</p>
		<p>I did some shopping and buying a collapsible coat among other things and took the 1.30 train arriving at Fareham at 4, where [Christo]fer and Ann and Judy were waiting for me “alone with Mr. Cave” in the car. Great hugs and shouts and awed peeps into my Magic Ear, and much satisfaction with the spades that were supposed to have dropped out of it.</p>
		<p>Alys seems gloriously well, Logan not as well as I hoped. His wound hasn’t quite healed, and there is still some bladder infection.</p>
		<p>Sent the poor Navers £25. He is v[ery] ill.</p>
