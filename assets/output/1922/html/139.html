		<p>In the morning Mrs. Ross and Lina came to see me, Lina over for 2 days from the Genoa Conference, where she gets £10 a day, and board and lodging, as Garvin’s Secretary. She sits at the right hand of God the Father (Lloyd George) and is gloriously “in it”, enjoying herself thoroughly, dear creature. But what a buzz!</p>
		<p>Charley Bell came to see B. B.</p>
