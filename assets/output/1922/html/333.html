		<p>Fine              Naimi</p>
		<p>Glorious day, our first. Lady Kitson and her daughter, Julia and her friend Miss Pellett, came to lunch, and afterwards I took them all to Villa Medici. Geoffrey looked pale and nervous. We walked a bit together, but found nothing to say. What, indeed, is there for us, who used to follow together so affectionately everything we each did and felt and thought? It was terribly sad, especially as I am sure our hearts are hardening against eachother [sic], partly in self-defence.</p>
		<p>I called on Strong, and then took Lady the Kitsons to call on Mrs. Ross.</p>
		<p>The Waterfields dined here. Lina is a brave soul. She went off by the night train to Rome to try to get an interview with Mussolini for her paper, the “Observer”. It is a pity she hasn’t more brains, but she makes up with character and genuine modesty and interest in her job.</p>
