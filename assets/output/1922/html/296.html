		<p>ZÃ¤hringer Hof. Frieburg [sic] c/Br</p>
		<p>Cold</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>We were here in 1895 for 3 weeks for a Berlioz-Listz [sic] Festival, concluded by Mottl. We learnt to bicycle here. The place is full of memories.</p>
		<p>We saw the Gallery thoroughly and _____ liked best the mysterious little Florentine picture.</p>
		<p>They made us pay 3000 m.[arks] per person for entering Baden!! B. B. could not get over his rage all day.</p>
		<p>We motored here, and found the Bea___ts with whom we dined. Francis Thorold came in, such an attractive boy. He is studying German here for diplomacy.</p>
		<p>B.B. was taken ill at the end of dinner, must have been a chill caught at the Cathedral where we stood till 6.30 in an icy wind for an hour looking at the sculptures with no tea in our tummies! Nothing will he allow to interfere with his sight-seeing. It is fine but also foolish.</p>
