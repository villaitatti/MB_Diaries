		<p>Motored across the old St. Gotthard across which I came so often in the train to go back to England and see mother. Up to Goeschenen it is beautiful, but then it gets bare and grim, and the descent from the top is awful, corkscrew windings on the face of a precipice. It is over 7000 feet high, and you drop sharply down, and the sudden change makes you feel sick. I donâ€™t want to motor across this pass again.</p>
