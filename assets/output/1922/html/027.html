		<p>Cold worse         </p>
		<p>So so day</p>
		<p>Nicky arrived at 5.30 a.m! dear creature! B.B. and I went to the Museum and then to the French Institute for lunch w. Storrs. We came back and took Nicky a drive along the native streets. She entered into the spirit of it.</p>
		<p>Then B.B. and I went to Lady Allenby’s musical. Mme. de Cramer</p>
		<p> played gloriously—a great artist. We met the Mackintoshes, Elgoods, Sérionnes, Russells, Storrs, Creswell, Mme. Foucart, and various then new acquaintances.</p>
		<p>Mrs. De Kaven writes “I am well and for the moment restored to the normal-by companionship [Spender] I shall never be free from suffering without it. I have lived the life à deux too long. A cultivated mind—a keenly sensitive responsiveness (aha?)—a high and very faithful idea of friendship provide very reliable foundations for just the sort of companionship wh. I fancy is bad for me at this time of the day.”</p>
