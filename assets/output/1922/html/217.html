		<p>Bad Kissingen</p>
		<p>Interviewed the doctor—the usual tale, I’m fat (how fat!!) and gouty, B.B. is thin and dyspeptic. I haven’t the faith of a grain of mustard seed in the Cure! It is, du reste, very mild.</p>
		<p>We had a huge p___, and I spent the morning writing to Jo Duveen about his mother’s death, about the Pisanello Portrait, the Maurice Hewlett “Baldovinetti” (really Pier Francesco Fiorentino) etc.</p>
		<p>Alys wrote that little Christopher enquired “When is Gram coming home with three spades in her Magic Ear?” Barbara begins to write semi grown-up letters. Karin couldn’t stand Karersee and the exclusive company of the Amoses more than 3 days (tho[ugh] she likes Maurice), and has gone on to join Byba at Kitzebühel.</p>
		<p>Walked about, read Countess Tolstoi’s [sic] Autobiography etc.</p>
