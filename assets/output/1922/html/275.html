		<p>Hotel du Théatre des Champs-Elysées</p>
		<p>6 Avenue Montaigne Paris</p>
		<p>Cold</p>
		<p>cloudy</p>
		<p>Called with Ray on the Thorolds and bought some of their chairs and curtains.</p>
		<p>Lunched with Lady Strachey and saw Simon Bussy’s remarkable Animal pictures. They should have a success when he exhibits them next month. His pastel of Barbara is finished and is really very charming.</p>
		<p>At 3 we left the Vit___ Hotel and motored to Croydon. There Ray discovered she had forgotten her passport—!! But they let her get onto the airplane (Handley-Page) and we flew over Deal and Boulogne and Beauvais to Paris, reaching the Hotel Crillon (having motored from the landing-place, Le Bourget) at 7, a swift, well-arranged, comfortable journey. The only drawback is the noise. The chief thing I noticed was that the sea looked solid under a thin veil of waves.</p>
		<p>Saw Carey for a minute but dined by ourselves at the Lapérouse.</p>
