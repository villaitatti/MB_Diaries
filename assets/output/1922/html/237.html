		<p>Frankfort a/MFrankf√ºrter Hof</p>
		<p>We motored here, missing our way, but gaining thereby a lovely run along the banks of the Main beyond Lohr. Arrived about 7, and dined and spent the evening with the Dumarts, who were indeed most kind. Unfortunately nearly the whole of their conversation is nauseating either from boastfulness or flattery. Nevertheless he has a grip on political and business affairs. He was 2 years Consul in Dublin, and knows the full hopelessness of the Irish situation. He says it is largely engineered by the Church, inspired by such hatred of England that they go blindly on, even now, when their lawlessness is putting England right with the world!</p>
