		<p>Karin called. Her Analyst won’t allow her to speak of her treatment! But she seemed well and jolly.</p>
		<p>Went to the Völkerkunde Museum and saw the Turfan frescoes and statues with their finder, Doktor De Kok. Chinese-Indian-Greek influence. c. VII to IX centuries.</p>
		<p>Went to Tristan und Isolde in the evening. A lot of it is boring, but when it is great it is divine. If it were 2 hours long it would be perfect.</p>
