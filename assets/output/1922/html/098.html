		<p>SS.</p>
		<p>Still in sandbanks. It is growing a bore, especially as Philom√®ne is very nervous at being out of reach of news from her little daughter.</p>
		<p>With all her charm she exasperated me terribly by her second-rate arguments. She has been thoroughly poisoned by fashionable Jesuitism, and is too fundamentally uneducated to see through it. She repeats their arguments like a vehement and rather acrimonious parrot. BB. mercifully finds her stimulating. He enjoys the talk her folly draws out of him. She is as sensitive as a sea-medusa to the least hostile current, and stiffens herself up to spit against it like a cobra. Sometimes you wonder why that particular innocent remark draws out her venom, but you soon realize that she is clever enough to feel that its implications are anti-Catholic, anti-immortality, anti-nationalistic.</p>
