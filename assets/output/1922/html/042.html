		<p>On the Nile</p>
		<p>A day without stopping, every single moment fascinating, fascinating! The desert and the sun, the Arabian mtns., the boats, the Shaduks, the people sitting motionless along the mud banks, the veiled women coming down for water, the camels and gamooses against the sky line, the sunset—dear Nicky—everything delightful.</p>
		<p>Von Warlich turned up on board with a (rich) friend named Sanderson. There are also some California Deerings, but the company on board is not interesting.</p>
		<p>Read half of Parkyn’s “Prehistoric Art.</p>
