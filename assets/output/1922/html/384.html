		<p>Fine day at last!{straddling both pages} Bessie</p>
		<p>Alys</p>
		<p>Called for Julia Mantegazza (Anita Cagnola’s grand daughter) and took him [sic] up to the children’s party at Villa Medici. Geoffrey and I had a walk round the garden and a chat on quite indifferent things, which nevertheless left a pleasant feeling. But I felt despairing sadness behind his nice behaviour. O what a disappointing fool he was!</p>
		<p>Lina and Aubrey  and Mr. Trevor Bigham (Hon[orable]) came to lunch, and we actually sat out in the stanzare</p>
		<p>Looked at mediaeval statues (reproductions) in evening. Bessie is very real and intelligent about sculpture, so much improved from the old days when she whined around caring for nothing outside her own skin.</p>
