		<p>Mr. Robert Benson   Fine</p>
		<p>Lady Wake</p>
		<p>Robert Benson and his daughter Lady Wake (wife of Hereward the Wake!) arrived in the morning. He is much aged (72), but is chatty and full of art gossip.</p>
		<p>Took them to call on Lina and Aubrey, and in the afternoon we walked over the hill down to Gamberaia, which we saw.</p>
