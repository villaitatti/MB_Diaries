		<p>Cloudy and misty              {straddling both pages} Flora Priestley</p>
		<p>Naimi</p>
		<p>Flora talks like a windmill in a hurricane. Both Robin Barton and Erskine Childers, her two pets, are in Mountjoy Prison, eaten up by lice. Well, they’ve _____ money a man to the next world in their idiotic Irish Republicanism. But of course they think they are Martyrs. It is awful to think of Flora going about the world with that ceaseless tongue—like Sybil yesterday, who talked almost worse than ever, choking your own words back into your throat and talking away your breathing. Poor, poor Geoffrey, what an ass, what a hopeless ass he was. I wrote to him, but not on this topic. Read “Mastering our Nerves”.</p>

		<p>The woes begin for me and for others—but others</p>
