		<p>Frankfürter Hof</p>
		<p>Called on Mrs. Dumont, then spent morning at Städelinstitut looking among other things at the Italian drawings.</p>
		<p>Sacred are the Vermeer, the small Raphael Titian portrait, the B. Veneto Courtesan, the Palma nude women, the Vermeer architect, the M. Caravaggio Bacchus and the Maître de Flémalle Crucifixion.</p>
		<p>Lunched with Dumonts, Schwarz___ and Prince Richard of Hesse {quotation marks, probably referring to “Schwarz___,” which is immediately above} took us to Wiesbaden to see the Hänkels’ pictures. Very nice people. Also to Hirsch’s house in Frankfort, with pictures, books, objets d’art, furniture, carpets and cheerlessness.</p>
		<p>Dined and talked with Dumonts.</p>
