		<p>Gallery in morning. It gets worse and worse. We know less than we did! Went back to Gallery.</p>

		<p>Dr. Maclellahan, the head of the Presbyterian College here, came to lunch to talk over the Alfred Nicholson situation. He was very reasonable and nice and said he didn’t want the boy to stay if it was a misfit. Alfred came in in the evening full of his problem, poor lad, but also dying to talk poetry and books. There’s much more in him than in Jim Whitall.</p>
