		<p>Saw Karnak. It is madly picturesque and of course it is HUGE. But uncouth, unhomely, not to be made terms with.</p>
		<p>Saw Luxor Temple with M. Lacaud the general director of the Service des Antiquités. He said he didn’t believe there was any misticism [sic] in the Egyptian religion. Where they worshipped a Ram they worshipped the animal tout court, not as a symbol. He said Everything was painted, even the black granite statues.</p>
