		<p>Zangwills        Rain and scirocco</p>
		<p>Took Zangwills down, and I called on Bardini to see the things he wants to sell to the Duveens.</p>
		<p>Baron von Hadeln came to lunch, without adding any joy to the occasion.</p>
		<p>I took the Zangwills to call on Miss Pagel, who was most brilliant. Miss Mabel Price also was there.</p>
		<p>A trying dinner-party, with the Ojettis and Mrs. Ross and Confusion of Tongues. I was really bored till I was frightened about my mental condition.</p>
		<p>Read Zangwill on Zionism aloud to B.B.</p>
