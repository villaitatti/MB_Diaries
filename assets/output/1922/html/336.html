		<p>Glorious              Mrs. Cameron</p>
		<p>“M_ra__ Summer”</p>
		<p>Went ahead with the notes.</p>
		<p>Mr. Offner came and stayed to lunch. Took B.B. and Lizzie Cameron to call on the Strongs and first a walk around an old “rampart walk” at Fiesole. Lizzie is so short-sighted, she sees almost nothing. She and B.B. called on Sybil while Nicky and I walked towards home</p>
		<p>Chitchat in [evening]. One _____ to gossip with her.</p>
