		<p>Downpour              Naimi</p>
		<p>Got to work again on the notes of our summer visits to museums.</p>
		<p>Signor Nicodemi, Director of the Brescia Gallery came at 10.30 and we sent down to get his wife, a charming nice woman to come for lunch. He is writing on R_a_i_o.</p>
		<p>I felt really quite ill and retired to bed. Liver, I am sure.</p>
		<p>I went out to dine at Casa Boccaccio with the Waterfields, awful food but nice people, living in a gay hand-to-mouth fashion, very cheerfully. Lina is the wage-earner, making nearly Â£400 a year by being Italian correspondent f___ Italy.</p>
