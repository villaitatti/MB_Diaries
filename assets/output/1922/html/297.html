		<p>Drei Königen, Basel</p>
		<p>Cold</p>
		<p>rain</p>
		<p>clear evening</p>
		<p>Got off late and did not reach the frontier till one o’clock. Found we had to deposit 3300 Swiss francs, and had only 300. Banks closed till Monday [morning]—! The thing BB and Eliza and Pa___y worried themselves sick over—i.e. the customs—was a[s] simple as daylight, no trouble—but of course the unexpected happened. However, I remembered we had letters from Friedländer etc to a collector-dealer, Wendlandt, so we telephoned and he rushed out in his car, bringing Swiss Bonds as ____ever _ he could not gather the money on a Sat[urday] afternoon! So all was well and B. B. remained perfectly calm!</p>
		<p>Saw the 2 museums with him and had tea at his delightful XVIII villa, with his nice wife, and saw his pictures. He is a  _____ of dealer, but lives very nicely in a refined way.</p>
