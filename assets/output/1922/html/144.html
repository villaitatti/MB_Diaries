		<p>Logan           I {continued on the facing page}</p>
		<p>Naimi</p>
		<p>Got up for lunch with the Salveminis. Usual thing, he lovable, she heavy and embarrassing.</p>
		<p>Went with Logan to call at Villa Medici in order that no trouble should arise—though I wish them thousands of miles away. But B. B. has been very bearish and rude. Geoffrey seemed in a cage, it is very painful to see him there.</p>
		<p>Brought back the Archibald Russells, and Col. L___rs and Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick Owen (16 Princes Gardens SW. 7) came to tea. All boring.</p>
		<p>Ammannati came up, revealing vast expenses.</p>
		<p>Finished Simkovitch’s “Towards the Understand of [Christ]”, with better essays on the Decline of Rome and Hay and Villages</p>
		<p>Wrote to Princess Bassiano, Philomène S. Dorotea, Lucca</p>
