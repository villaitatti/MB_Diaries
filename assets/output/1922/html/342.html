		<p>Fine          Miss Hopkinson</p>
		<p>and Miss Vaughan</p>
		<p>Had a good walk before Mrs. Cameron left at 5. I went down with her and called on Elisina Igler and her daughter Gioia, and saw Dr. Filippi there. Brought up Leslie Hopkinson and her friend Miss Vaughan for a “waking up in the Tuscan country.” Evening passed mildly, but not unpleasantly, only Miss Vaughan does not know how to select in her conversation.</p>
