		<p>Began work on our summer’s notes. Mrs. Ross, Mrs. Hooker and her daughter and their friend, Miss Musgrave, came to lunch. B.B. talk too much about tiresome disagreeable things, such as bad hotels, customs bothers and so on. He has an awful cold and cannot go out. I haven’t had a cold since Jan[uary] and I put it down to sticking some mildly disinfectant grease up my nose every night. Miss Tone hasn’t had a cold since she began to do the same thing a year ago! But as B.B. insists on believing that colds come from chills and draughts he scorns my preventive—and takes the consequences.</p>
		<p>I called on the Waterfields at Casa Boccaccio, but they were out. All the contadini etc. got hold of me for fearful tales of woe. Poor things. I’ll do what I can.</p>
