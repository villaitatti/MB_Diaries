		<p>Eugenie left at noon. On the whole—tho[ugh] she is a tiresome fusser—her visit went off well. I am really fond of her and so is B.B.</p>
		<p>Too rainy for calls, but I had</p>
		<p>Mr. and Mrs. Norwood Young</p>
		<p>Mrs. Clarke</p>
		<p>2 [young] American from Cambridge England</p>
		<p>Miss Nixon</p>
		<p>Miss Shelder</p>
		<p>Miss Underwood</p>
		<p>Julia and Hilda</p>
		<p>{2 skipped lines}</p>
		<p>B.B. lost his temper twice once over psycho-analysis and secondly because Parry wasn’t back in time. This led him to rage at my ALWAYS putting HIM last, never considering HIS interests and the whole chain—when such a thing as Parry’s staying on in town was never done before!! Poor B.B. {a line leads to the next page, where this day’s narrative continues}</p>
