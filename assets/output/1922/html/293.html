		<p>Frankfürter HofNice morning</p>
		<p>Grey afternoon</p>
		<p>A last view of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum and at 2 left for Frankfurt where we arrived at 11.30. Quite a comfortable train.</p>
		<p>Nicky went to Munich to see her sister.</p>
		<p>Bode saw B.B. once with some fashionably dressed ladies— “How dreadful for that learned man to go about and waste his time with such shocking cocottes!” “But they are Princess so-and-so and Duchess the-other,” etc. “Gott in Himmel, to think that such people can take up with a wretched creature like Berenson!”</p>
		<p>It appears there is huge Bode-Berenson cycle in Germany, of which this is an episode.</p>
