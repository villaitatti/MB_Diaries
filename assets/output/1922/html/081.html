		<p>Went to the Tombs of the Nobles in the morning with Mr. Davies. The first one he showed us had a remarkably fine painting of an Ibex, like a Pisanello. Another tomb had the back ____ (Â¾) of a girl, the only instance.</p>
		<p>Lunched with the Davies: such nice people.</p>
		<p>Heavy scirocco. {lower on the page, beginning on this line and offset to the right, is a picture of Mary and an unidentified man}</p>
		<p>Did not sleep until 4.</p>
