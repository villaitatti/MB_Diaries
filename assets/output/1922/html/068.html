		<p>Luxor Temple. Call on Lady Allenby in garden.</p>
		<p>We took the snake-charmer, Moussa, in Dr. Edersâ€™ boat (he is the sanitary officer of Zanzibar and son of Mrs. Plummer, who also is here), and Dr. and Mrs. Willock, up the river, chose an over place, got out and watched him hunt for snakes. He found many scorpions and finally a black-throated spitting cobra. V[ery] long. He wd. have made more play w. it, but it spat in his eye, wh. swelled up. Both doctors were absolutely convinced of his skill, tho they did not believe his incantations had anything to do with it.</p>
