		<p>Museum, a thoroughly good go, but at noon a terrible Khamseen came on, bearing the dust in swirls like sand-spouts, and a frightful, heavy heat. We all thought our last hour had come. However, we braced up and went out at 4 to the Fadawieh Mosque at Abbasieh, and then to Mrs. Bramley’s for tea, where were Mrs. Noel (from Greece), the Countess Villamarina and her daughter Mrs. Macdonell, Mrs. Kirkwood (the old dear), Comtesse de Sérionne, Mme. Cattaui Pascha, the Herraris etc. While we were there the sky cleared and it grew cool and pleasant. Cresswell came with us.</p>
