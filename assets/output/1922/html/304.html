		<p>Naimi{straddling both pages} I Tatti</p>
		<p>Fair weather</p>
		<p>Reached Florence at 7. Naimi was kindly waiting to greet me. Found everything in good order at home, but Colombo not arrived.</p>
		<p>Went to see Aunt Janet—no change, her life is taken up in adoring David and his family, and loathing Lina’s family and being annoyed with Lina. I drove her to town and left some letters and did some errands, picked up Naimi and came home.</p>
		<p>Naimi is in love again, and feels happy and jung (as she calls it)[.] I am so glad. But my Lord what a Bore people in love are, saying _____ and _____ the same thing. Still I sympathize, and hope it may end in a happy marriage</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky still at Milan</p>
