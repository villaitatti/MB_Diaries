		<p>In the evening we went to an orchestral concert and heard Strauss’ Don Juan and “Eugenspiel”, after which the “Meistersäuger” sounded very conventional! A young Dutch composer named Dirch Foch [sic] came with us. We liked him.</p>

		<p>I read V. Sackville-West’s volume “The Heir”. Disappointing after her bigger books “The Heritage” and “A Dragon in Shallow Waters”. More like theme writing. But she has talent</p>
