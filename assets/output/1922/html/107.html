		<p>Went to Alfred’s “Presbyterian University” in morning. Museum. Oh endless. And very tiring. Patricolo came to lunch and took us to see the Dancing Dervishes. What an experience. It evoked hundreds of profound commonplaces in one’s mind—useless to write down. But there is hardly anything more fascinating than to clothe a commonplace with picturesqueness and human reality. Their shirts blew out like the petals of flowers, they seemed to propel themselves by their slowly waving arms. It was most decorous, even solemn, like a Quaker meeting at its best. Also like a madhouse.</p>
		<p>Then we saw the lovely adjoining Tomb of Hassan Saddaka with its lacelike [sic] stuccoes, even on the cupola: the mosque twin tombs of Sangar el Gouby Gawaly (?) with the almost romanesque open carved screens: and finally Ibn Tulun. Climbed the tower for sunset. Awful fatigue!!</p>
