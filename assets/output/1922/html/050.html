		<p>Nile boat Luxor</p>
		<p>Early start to Queenâ€™s Tombs etc., Ramasseum and surrounding Temples, Colossi. The Tomb paintings were really dull and poor. The Temples very picturesque and impressive, in some ways beautiful. The wall sculptures on the whole poor, but some roof decorations etc. very good.</p>
		<p>Nothing to upset us any more, or make us feel European and inferior.</p>
		<p>Afternoon joined forces with M. and Mme. Neguib Pascha [sic], Mme. von Cramer and the Italian Minister Negrotti and went back to Karnac, beautiful at sunset. Saw the famous Sekmet statue in the gloom.</p>
		<p>Mme. Neguib is an Armenian, very charming. Her husband a Copt bounder.</p>
