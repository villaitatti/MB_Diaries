		<p>Warsash  Grey but not raining</p>
		<p>Went with [children] to beach and had a stroll alone along the cliff, in how different a mood than at the end of 1918 when I got up from that long illness and all the world was a torture-house, within and without. It is a less vivid, less intense state of mind—rather commonplace, in fact, but it is nice not to suffer.</p>
		<p>The rest of the day was spent in hearing interminable tales of the Nordhoff family[.] Saidee is one of those who gives you a sense of a bottomless sack to [sic] empty, of being able to recount the whole of their lives to any listening ear. She is nice, too, but oh dear!</p>
		<p>Walked out with the [children] to see the Boy Scouts’ camp, and then with Alys and Julia to ask permission to use a hut by the beach. Read Santayana on Dickens, etc.</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky at Hildesheim.</p>
