		<p>In the afternoon BB. and I called at Herr Casserèr’s, but he had to go out, so we looked at pictures and photos with Herr Blumenreich, and saw also Casserèr’s modern things. His Cézannes and Manets and Van Gogh’s [sic] made BB feel that the orange-coloured flowers on the dining-room table were still more beautiful. That’s all they try to do—to give you the appearances of actual things. Imagine seeing anything that would make you say “This is Bellini’s ‘Feast’, or Botticelli’s ‘Birth of Venus’ mais en beau!!” This is the essence of the matter.</p>
		<p>Terry Fürholzer and Karin and Adrian came to tea and supper with the intensely amusing “Madame Pompadour” _____, acted deliciously by Massari.</p>
