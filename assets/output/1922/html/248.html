		<p>Rain and wind    Big Chilling</p>
		<p>A milk diet day</p>
		<p>Saidee developed a chill on the kidneys and took to her bed, with a hot-water bottle. I developed slight cystitis from the cold but am curing it with Logan’s “Cystopurin” (3 times a day, dissolved in water, after meals). Chatted with Saidee and played “Boat” with the children, wrote many letters and paid a lot of book bills. Too cold and rainy to walk.</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky must be in Cassel today</p>
		<p>{2 skipped lines}</p>
		<p>Read Algar’s rather confused article on von Hügel’s books—very disappointing. He writes badly, and his thought seems unclear.</p>
