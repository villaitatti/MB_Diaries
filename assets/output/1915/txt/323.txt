Geoffrey Scott
 
  Geoffrey still liver-y, poor thing.
I am sending garments to soldiers at the front, so many touching appeals. Alas.
  Bernard and I walked over old Careggi mound, over the pine-hill. It is being enclosed as hospital ground. We have walked there for 25 years. 
  Called on Bassianos. She suffered so she says she’ll never have another baby.
This one is a great beauty already, although only 4 days old.
