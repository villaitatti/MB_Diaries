Geoffrey Scott, Florence Baldwin
 Scirocco
  My cold still weighs heavily on me. Flora Priestley came to lunch, bringing the very bad news that Henry James had had two strokes. He was left with speech and his mind, however.
Mrs. Baldwin went to Acton’s with Geoffrey, and hated the house and garden, and then paid a brief call at Sybil’s.
