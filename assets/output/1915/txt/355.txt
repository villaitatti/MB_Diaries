  Such a heavenly day–but Ray says she can’t let Barbara come out, and all was black, until we got out on that wonderful Madonna del Sasso walk, BB and Naima and I.
  When we came in, Prince Paul of Serbia, Nello and the weird-looking, tiger-eyed Marchesa Casati were here. They stayed a long time.
  The Consul and his wife came to lunch. They say Loeser without a passport may have to go back to America, as the US wishes to have no German-Americans living abroad at this moment, and it is making it very awkward for them.
