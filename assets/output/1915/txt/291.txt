Saturday, September 25, 1915, Caprarola
Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
  Lunched at Orvieto, and rain came on. We reached Caprarola for tea in a downpour.
Mrs. Baldwin has lost her beauty, poor thing, but keeps the values of a frivolous adventuress. It is very painful–horrible.
Yet she is extremely able and has not only restored this huge place admirably but has made over her village and is now doing a valuable war work. I admire her and yet abhor her.
