  The most heavenly day but I had to go in to town to take Mrs. Ross to tea with the Dowdeswells. Savage Landon came in and said he was just off to England to sell an invention he had made to destroy submarines.
  Interviewed a nurse for Karin. She is named Ida Steury (Swiss) and has been 6 years with the Herrans.Â
