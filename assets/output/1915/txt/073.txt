  Sybil called and BB went back to tea with her.
Cecil came in and said he thought he would have to go to the War after all. His brother has been sent to the Front after only 2 month’s drill.
It will be an awful calamity for us.
I do not believe he will ever come back, he is not strong enough to survive it. It is heartbreaking. I am so fond of him.
  Geoffrey and I had a gloomy walk, especially as, at lunch, BB was in such a rage with Cecil he wouldn’t hear of any Terms we might make about at least finishing the Library.
Geoffrey was upheld, though, by having had a really charming letter from “Nicky Mariano” who is in Russia. He is ½ in love with her already. Well, I have Barbara, and envy no one!
