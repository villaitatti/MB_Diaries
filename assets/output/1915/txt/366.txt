Scirocco
Mrs. Baldwin
 
 Still in bed with influenza. Mrs. Baldwin arrived at 2, but left her dress-suit case behind her in the train. The Dumonts and Marainis came to dine, while Geoffrey went to dine with Sybil.
BB took Sybil a drive, and the machine got stuck in the mud and had to be hauled out by contadini. 
  Ammannati came and cast great woe into my soul by saying the cook’s books were an average of 86 francs a day–quite monstrous.
