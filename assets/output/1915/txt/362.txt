Geoffrey Scott, Naima Lofroth
Dull
  Geoffrey in bed. Miss Cohen came to lunch. Walked down from “the Grove”. 
Wrote to Ray, Alban, Spragues, Sally Harlan, Alys.
  Got very angry with the men servants for their inability to organize the service of Geoffrey’s meals in his room. They are really awfully stupid, but I suppose they can’t help it.
I am led to believe that getting angry is the only way to impress Italian servants, but it is very degrading for one’s self.
