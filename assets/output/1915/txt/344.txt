Geoffrey Scott 
Beautiful
 
  Dreadful day for BB. Could not find 2 photos he wanted in the portfolios I brought him, and he became like a madman with rage–said he would leave the house and never return–and all sorts of things.
  There was only one place where they could be, the place where we put all the as yet undistributed photos, but Geoffrey and I were so paralyzed and upset by his rage that we could not find the Piero della Francesca photo. By lunch he had calmed down a little, and in the afternoon we had a pleasant walk. But I was most awfully upset and couldn’t sleep.
