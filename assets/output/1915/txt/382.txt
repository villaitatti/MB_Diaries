Rain, muggy
  Lina and her nice youngster came to see me before I was up, and transformed my peaceful bedroom into a Menagerie. I loved it. Julia and Naima and I went there for tea and games. Sybil and Irene called here, the latter to say goodbye, as she is going tomorrow. Cecil and Geoffrey dined at Villa Medici.
