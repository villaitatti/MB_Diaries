Sunday, December 26, 1915, I Tatti
4 lunch, 5 dinner
Julia, Naima Lofroth, Geoffrey Scott
Fairish warm
  Naima lunched with Mrs. Ross. Julia and Gordon explored the laghetto. Geoffrey and I talked ourselves deaf and blind. But it all perfectly clear to me, and I see him walking into a very perilous trap, and sophisticating himself (and sometimes me) into thinking “I’m sure that's not a hook.”
However young people must try their experiments however dangerous. 
  BB had a walk with Naima, and I with Geoffrey.
