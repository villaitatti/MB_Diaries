Cold, fine
 
  Ray’s trouble seems to be “nervous” after all, for the doctor finds there was no miscarriage this time, and infers there wasn’t the last time. But it is now too late for darling Barbara to have a real companion.
B.B. and Geoffrey and I had a walk in the laghetto and then BB and I called on Aunt Janet, who does seem very broken and aged.
We are all getting positively sea-sick with newspapers!
