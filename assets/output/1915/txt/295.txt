 Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott 
  Motored from Caprarola. Had lunch by Lake of Bolsena. Saw Monteoliveto.
Found letter from Inez Boisservaire, who has been sent home by the Italian Government. She richly deserved it!
“I’m not pro-German–” she wrote, “not in the least–nothing would grieve me more than a German victory–except a victory for the Allies. I am against war–all war–that is all. And if this war ends with a victory gained by military strength, we shall have militarism rampant in the world for a long time to come. I want an intelligent adjudication and I want it soon. And I don’t go on the theory that any parties to the certified are more to blame than the others. I am not interested in placing blame. I am interested in avoiding such stupidities for the future.”
The Italian government evidently was interested in avoiding such stupidities for the present.
