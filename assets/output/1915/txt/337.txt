  Worked on North Italians. Nello came to go over with BB the translation of his 4 books and then Yoï came to lunch looking somewhat pale and drawn from childbirth. (Harry Wladimir Maraini Sept 23), and extraordinarily boring and false. What an ill-assorted couple–he so keen and full of impersonal interests, she so bound up in sex-vanity and self absorbed. She is getting very restive with the narrowness of the life he imposes on her. It will end badly.
  Geoffrey came back. BB and I had a walk after the rain at dusk, under the new moon.
  We are reading Busch on Bismarck.
