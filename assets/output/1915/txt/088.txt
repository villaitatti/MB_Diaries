Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Vida Bispham
Fine
 
  Had a walk with Geoffrey while BB called on Sybil, as usual.
The Dumonts came to dine and Margaret Strong. The “young people” went off into the music-room and seemed to enjoy themselves. Even Geoffrey liked it. How I wish I could have plenty of youngsters about.
