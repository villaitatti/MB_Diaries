Fine, Snow deep
Geoffrey Scott, Naima
 
  Alys writes that Logan is not wanted at Dunkirk, they have already found someone to do the job. I am awfully relieved. He is in the meantime working hard for the Belgian refugees.
 
Byba Giuliani came and took Geoffrey for a walk, and then came in and paid a call.   
  BB afternoon at Sybil’s.
