Geoffrey Scott
  Walked with BB and Geoffrey over the quarries. A most wonderful day and a delicious walk.
The Hultons and Reggie Temple dined here. The latter, after going to see Herbert Horne every day for 4 years, and spending from 1-5 hours at each visit, suddenly stopped, about a year ago, and hasn’t been near him since. Pure caprice. I hope I persuaded him to go again, for Horne felt it very much. But of course he never lets anyone become friends with him.
