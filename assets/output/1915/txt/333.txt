  Began to grapple with accounts. I am about as unsuited for this as a rabbit for driving a motor-car!
Walked with BB on the Careggi hill, called on the Bassianos, and on Mascha to say goodbye. Her husband has taken to drinking once more.
  Vida Bispham and her husband Riccardo Daddi came to dine. He is a nice young fellow, serious and good, but delicate and with a harsh voice. She is certainly very boring. They’re horribly poor–£200 (francs) a month.
  BB said that Sybil had begun to bore him dreadfully, as does nothing but talk of her officers and her entertainment. I am not surprised, for she has always struck me as a peculiarly insistent bore.
