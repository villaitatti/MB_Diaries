  Margaret Strong brought Miss Vida Bispham (daughter of my old friend David, the singer) to lunch. We all liked her.
It was a lovely day and we sat in the stanzone. BB had a drive with Sybil and Geoffrey dined with her. Geoffrey and I had a beautiful walk over to Fiesole (under Castel di Poggio) but it was dark when I came back and the road was so stony I got tired.
Old age shows in the circulation in my hip, which are at times quite painful. Coraggio!
  Cecil got here from Balzorano [sic.] entirely disgusted with the muddle and confusion. He thinks nothing useful will be done.
