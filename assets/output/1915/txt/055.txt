  Cecil writes of the hopeless and cruel confusione that prevails in the earthquake zone. The timber came 15 days late and then couldn’t get unloaded because the railway siderigs were choked with wagons which sheltered not the unfortunate survivors but the Committees who had come to build barracks out of that same timber!!
   I wonder what would happen if Italy went to war? I hope they’ll keep out.
  Had a splendid walk and called on Aunt Janet, whom I found all alone crying.
  The Marainis came to dine, and left Geoffrey rather miserable. She seems utterly fake and boring. He is delightful. She says they have only £300 a year to live on.
  BB at Sybil’s in afternoon.
