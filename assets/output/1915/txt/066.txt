Geoffrey Scott
 
  Cecil went off to Rome and Balzorano [sic.].
  Walked with BB to Villa Medici and called on the Herberts (out) the Strongs, and Sybil. Came home with him in car. We discussed Miss Giuliani as a wife for Geoffrey, and decided it might just do, as she has plenty of money. She looks, BB said, like a “Levantine monkey” and she is very tiny, but I think she is a really good sort. She seems to be making a dead set at our young friend. He says there is no danger.
