A.W. Benn came to lunch, and Mrs. Krayl, very full of her complicated affaire [sic] with Gordon Craig, poor child. 
Placci and Salvemini came to dine, both sure that Italy is going to fight. Placci says on the 20th of this month, Salvemini on the 15th of February. 
What tragic nonsense it all is. 
[later] It really was the 23 of May.
