Monday, April 12, 1915, Hotel d’Italia, Urbino
Ray, Pippa, Geoffrey Scott
 
Saw Ducal Palace and frescoes of Salimbeni, and there motored to Borgo Sansepolcro, through deep snow, where we lunched. Then came home by the lower slopes of Vallombrosa, a most lovely road through that curious humped-up country. The afternoon was perfect.
  Found BB who had arrived from Siena last night. They seem to have been very happy.
