  Began work on North Italians–such fun.
Sybil came, and this time talked of Art and other non-war themes. BB had told her he simply couldn’t bear it when his friend turned into public institutions or philanthropical [sic] committees. 
  I called on poor asthmatic Miss Paterson and then on poor bronchial-pleurisy-enteritis Miss Preistley, an infinitely nicer creature.
  Geoffrey had Marcella Michela to tea.
