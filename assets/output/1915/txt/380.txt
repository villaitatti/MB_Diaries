Geoffrey Scott, Julia
Frost and more mist
  Shopped in town with Julia, Lina and Gordon, and brought Geoffrey back. Mr. Keeling, who has  been in the Embassy in Serbia and who has just accompanied 200 nurses from Uskub to the Albanian coast and across to Brindisi in a small Italian boat (they had to have 200 miles with about nothing to eat!) came to lunch. Afterwards BB and Geoffrey and I had a walk in the woods, while Julia and Eliza shopped. 
  Alys writes she is going to America in February!
