Naima, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
 
  Did absolutely nothing but read and work all day.
Cecil cleared up lots of household things, the angel, and then went to tea with Sybil, while BB (for a change) called on the Strongs. Geoffrey was awfully depressed, but got better after a walk all by himself. I couldn’t go, as my cold was heavy on me.
