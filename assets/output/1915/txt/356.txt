Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
Very Cold
 
  Prince Paul came to lunch. I suspect we should have put him at the head of the table! We all went up to Pratolino and walked about the park, saw the Villa and Napoleon's furniture, etc. and had tea. It would be glorious if he gave work to the boys, when he comes in for the property.
We were all awfully tired when we got home, and all had rheumatism. Geoffrey woke up with a very sharp attack in the night, which made him feel for the soldiers.
