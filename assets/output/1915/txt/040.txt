Sunday, January 17, 1915, I Tatti
 Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott, Naima
  Work in morning. In the afternoon B.B, and Naima had a drive to Monte Senario and Geoffrey and I called on Sybil and the Strongs, and walked back. Cecil called on Aunt Janet. B.B. got awfully cross, but I can see that he is anything but well. 
  Aunt Janet is terribly broken by Frank Crisp’s death.
   We sent £ 500 and clothes to the Terremoto Committee.
  Cecil got up at 9 quite restored from his savage feast.
