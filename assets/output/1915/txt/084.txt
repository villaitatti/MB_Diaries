Geoffrey Scott
Perfect
 
  Geoffrey has influenza, and Cecil came up to spend the night, instead of Geoffrey’s going down there.
Had a lovely walk alone, which I prefer to anybody’s company almost–in fact, quite. It is the only way to escape into nature.
  BB had a motor drive in the Mugello with Sybil.
