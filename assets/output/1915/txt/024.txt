Yoï came up to lunch and was really silly enough to put into a lunatic asylum. I have never known a person more self-absorbed and impervious to the impression she makes on others–except, bien entendu, sexually–of that she is well aware.
 She went for a walk with Geoffrey in the Laghetto–the last time, B.B. says, such a thing must happen. Of course I only cared when Nello was away, by means of lies on her part, for she told me he was frightfully jealous. It was a bad beginning to the New Year.
