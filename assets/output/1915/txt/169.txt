Wednesday, May 26, 1915, Hotel Brufani Perugia
 
Went to Fossombrone and were shut up as German spies, until the Commanding officer got too hungry to wait any longer for his collazione [sic].
Strange sensation to be gazed at by myriads of hard, unfriendly eyes. The people are quite off their heads with excitement, and would have loved to lynch us!
Sybil’s letter from the Marchese Imperiali, Ambassador in Rome, was the only thing that counted.
Our passports were nothing. 
Came on to Perugia, rather disgusted.
