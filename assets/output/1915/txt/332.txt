  Raining nearly all day. I went out at 1:30 and dressmaked and shopped till 6. Horrible.
Sybil came to see BB and they had a walk.
Geoffrey dined with Sybil.
Advised Ray and Karin to invest their 1000 from Aunty Lill’s estate through Bontbright in New York.
  BB had a letter from Miss Greene after 3 months silence–a very ordinary sort of letter chiefly about money and deals, she explains her long silence by depression. Probably she is lying.
