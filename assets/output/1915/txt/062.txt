Rain
 
  Cold still rather heavy, but I had to go to town. I took Geoffrey down and then by chance met him later wandering vaguely with a letter to post, about new complications in the tragic history of his family. It is like a Greek cycle–an almost inevitable doom. May he escape it.
I called at Sybil’s for BB. She was in overwhelming voice, and I came away quite stunned.
Yoï and Nello came to dine and announced, with bursting pride on his part, and conscious sex satisfaction on hers, that a new baby was on its way.
She said it made Nello so unhappy to meet Geoffrey here that he almost gave up coming, and I felt that Geoffrey and I have been very self-absorbed not to think of Nello’s side. Fortunately Geoffrey was away, dining with the Giulianis.
