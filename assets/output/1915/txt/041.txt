Geoffrey Scott, new footman Domenico Pieri
  Foot sore, so could not walk. Went to town with Geoffrey, and called for BB at Sybil’s at 6. He says she reminds him of a cicala, no body or insides but all voice. I have never known anybody [to] talk the way she does. I can hardly bear it, although I am inclined to like her. 
  Poor B.B. is not well. I feel really troubled and anxious about him. He doesn’t sleep well, and he can’t digest. Most of the time he feels awfully tired.
  Yoï and Nello came to dine. Nello was charming. Yoï had a sneezing cold, and her manner was cooler and to me much more agreeable. The more intimate she feels the more she puts me in a false position by taking it for granted I “understand” and “sympathize with” all her foolishness.
