Fine
 
  I cursed today when the Marainis telephoned to ask if they could come up and look at the Art Magazines, for I do so love my quiet days.
However, I made an excuse of Mrs. Ross and got a long walk alone in the woods, which I truly love.  And Yoï wasn’t so bad. She’s been less gênante ever since Stan repeated to her some of the severe things I said. She sees I don’t “understand,” so she bothers me less.
  Later I called on poor Mrs. Ross, who has fallen into a sad apathy. She sits all day by the fire, only stirring to make it up, and shuddering and wincing from time to time as if someone struck her.
   B.B. went up to Sybil’s as usual.
She does talk – unceasingly.
