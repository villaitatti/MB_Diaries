  Went to Villino, and to Madame Roselmini about the move. Long confab with Ammannati about household expenses. I have been horribly careless. Didn’t quite dare to walk, but went a little in the garden. Madame Luchaire and her young friend, Marcella Michela, came to dine. The latter is very pretty, hard and bright, intelligent, amusing, but not sweet. Madame Luchaire stayed till midnight. It was far too long.
