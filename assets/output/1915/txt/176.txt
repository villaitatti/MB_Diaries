Wednesday, June 2, 1915, Albergo Pace, Scanno
 
Sybil’s motor skidded and BB’s head was wounded, but not seriously. Axle cracked, so we came on slowly to Sulmona***.
  Drive from Guardiagrele to Pescocostanzo absolutely divine along the Maiella–***
  Sulmona crowded with officers so we came up here to sleep.
