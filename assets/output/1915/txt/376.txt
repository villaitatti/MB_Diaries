Rainy and clearing
Cecil Pinsent, Naima Lofroth
 
  A quiet day, spent mostly in correcting BB’s manuscript. This time he has surpassed himself in bad writing!
  BB and Naima went for a walk, and I called on Lina and Aunt Janet. Lucien and his wife called. He goes back to Udine tomorrow.
  Marcella took tea and dined with Geoffrey. She is a very unconventional creature and does just what she feels like doing. But I think she is a nice creature, too.
