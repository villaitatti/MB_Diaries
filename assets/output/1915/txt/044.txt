  Day of heavenly do nothing.  I mean nothing involving others, but just the work I like to do in the Library, with no one to bother me. I love such days, though I love them more when Geoffrey’s sitting opposite to me, also at work.
  This year, for the first time in my life, I feel peaceful and at leisure. Nothing hurries or bothers me. It comes from having good health and very fine people to see and make social arrangements for.
If it weren’t for the War I should be happy. But that is such ghastly background that it is nearly intolerable.
  BB at Sybil’s.
