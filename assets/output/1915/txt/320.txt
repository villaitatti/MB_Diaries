  The Blackes have lost their second son, on the French Front. Poor people.
We are all terribly low about the war, with these Balkan complications. It is too miserable to talk about.  
  BB and Naima motored up Monte Morello, and Geoffrey and I walked in the garden borders waiting for Lady Enniskillen, who came very late. She, too, is depressed and anxious.
