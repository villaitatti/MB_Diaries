Better
  Had rather a hump, but got over it. Had a nice walk with BB down from San Clemente and left him at Sybil’s. 
  Geoffrey went in to dine with Marcella Michela. 
  Yoï and Nello dined here. She was very nice at first, and I began to think I had been unjust to her, when all of a sudden she began on the Roy Kennard story all over again, worse than Mrs. Baldwin with her sad story. I was disgusted and bored. Later on, she told me she didn’t really care anything about sex– “In spite of my wild life”–but greatly preferred to keep herself to herself. Does she take me for an idiot?
