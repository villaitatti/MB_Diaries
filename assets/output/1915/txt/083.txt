Rain again
 
  No home letters—but better War news–the Dardanelles really attacked and troops landing in the Gallipoli peninsula. Russian making a stand and even advancing, “blockade” fizzling out, and the “Dacia” towed by the French into Brest.
Walked with Bernhard halfway to la solita Sybil, and there called on Mrs. Ross and Miss Erichsen. Nello came to dine, but without Yoï, who is still sick. Oh but I envy her for Ray!
Geoffrey tells me that Byba Giuliani, who observes very keenly, thinks Yoï is neither contented nor happy, and that the marriage cannot turn out well. Italians read these things quickly. I think Byba knows nothing of the facts, but she sees Yoï is false and feels her to be dissatisfied.
