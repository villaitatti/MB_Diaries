Scirocco
Geoffrey Scott, Florence Baldwin
 
  Felt rather ill, but as no one else would, I took Florence Baldwin out and we visited the grave of her daughter Audrey and then the Gamberaia, deserted of its inhabitants who for 15 months have been running a soldier’s hospital at Biarritz.
When I came home I was about worn out with her silly and extraordinary talk, and made Geoffrey take her to the music room. He was consternated for he too is fed up with her.
She is extraordinarily like Yoï, but grown old and without any man’s protection. She called herself a “battered butterfly”.
