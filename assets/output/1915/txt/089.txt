Sunday, March 7, 1915, I Tatti
Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Vida Bispham
Fine and then cloudy
 
  Took Miss Bispham [on] a motor ride, and then called on Sybil and the Strongs.
It was a lovely day and we sat out after lunch, enjoying the sunshine. In the evening we went (but not B.B.) with the Loesers to the Folies Bergeres to see a French Music Hall actress called Mistinguett. It wasn’t very good, but on the other hand, we got home at 11:15, so no harm was done.
