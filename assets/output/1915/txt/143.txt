Friday, April 30, 1915, Hotel Brufani Perugia
Fine, rain, fine
 
  Motored to Gualdo Tadino by a new road. Lunched at the Castello there, in the garden. Saw Nocera and finally Trevi in a most lovely light.
Sybil, who had been very nice all along, suddenly got a talking fit, and shouted us all down and drove me to bed with my ears ringing and my face in uncomfortable smiles at her over emphasis of what she thought was humorous. She is really ghastly when she gets like that. But at bottom she is so nice that I must learn not to be disgusted and annoyed by this peculiarity.
  Rupert Brooke died out at Lemnos. Geoffrey was very fond of him. What a terrible waste it all is.
