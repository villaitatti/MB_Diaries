Tuesday, May 25, 1915, I Tatti
Urbino Albergo d’Italia
 
  Our motoring trip with BB and Sybil in her car driven by Parry, with Sybil’s maid, Lenty, and Geoffrey and I in our car driven by Cecil, with my maid Eliza. Got off about 11, lunched above Rignano, passed through Borgo Sansepolcro in a terrible rain, and got on to Urbino to find it full of refugees from Ancona, scared by the bombardment. 
  Great trouble to get rooms.
