Thursday, September 30, 1915, Albergo Universo Lucca
Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
 
  Left Siena at 10 and lunched under Volterra, having seen the Villa Celsa first–charming connecting gallery, chapel and gardens by Peruzzi.
  Saw Laré and inspected the Bagni di Casciano–nel caso mai.
Reached here in time to see the most glorified sunset there ever was from the city wall.
  BB writes “Sybil amuses me a bit and annoys me more by the indirection wherewith she goes back as every plan we make directly her hotel-keeping preoccupations demand it. Today another lot of ‘officers’ arrive and their indirection will take up most of her energies for the rest of my stay….The fact is, I wish you were back. I am not much of a visitor, except for 2 or 3 days at a time.
  HENRI was killed on the French front.
