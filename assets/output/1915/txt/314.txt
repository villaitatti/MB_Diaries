Monday, October 18, 1915, I Tatti
Took Mrs. Ross to lunch with the Dumonts. Then called on Horne who lives most uncomfortable in a stuffy little room at the top of his bare Palazzo, which he has furnished with a Carlo Dolci and a picture painted on variegated marble. He seemed very ill, but very keen, as always, about “collecting” (also about selling, I fancy). Then I went to see Yoï, who vaunted the return of her figure to its wanted grace after her 4th maternity. She had stood up nude for Nello to inspect it in every detail, and he was–enraptured!
