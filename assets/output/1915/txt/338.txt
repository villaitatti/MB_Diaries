Heavenly day very warm
 
  A Soldier’s epitaph
Poor old Bill! He left this place
With smoking guns and sinking face, 
But Bill won’t miss if some good chap 
Will follow up and fill the gap.
 
Lina walked over in the morning and called on the lady at the villino. Madame Luchaire, Marcella, and Nello came to lunch.
  I took Mrs. Ross and Lina to shop, called on Lady Enniskillen and Mrs. Dumont.
Aristea left.
  BB dined with Sybil.
