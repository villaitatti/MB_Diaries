   Got through BB’s article and, strange to say, he accepted all our corrections like a lamb. I had anticipated a bloody row. He took Sybil a drive and Lucien Henraux and his pretty wife came to dine. He told us some horrible stories of the Bosches, beyond the abstract stretches of imagination, however macabre or obscene.
  6 of the servants went to the theatre.
