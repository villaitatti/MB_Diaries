Cold
 
Karin’s 26th Birthday.
Wrote to her and to Ray and Alys.
Was very rheumatic and stayed in all day working and reading Cromer’s book on Egypt and a story of a Chinese Courtesan.
Benn came to lunch. We think he has had a slight stroke, although, apparently, he does not know it.
BB motored and had tea with Sybil.
Received a button sewed onto a rag by Barbara!!
