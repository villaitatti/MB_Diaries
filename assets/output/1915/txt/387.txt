Thursday, December 30, 1915, I Tatti
Geoffrey Scott, Julia
3 lunch 5 dinner
  Called with Geoffrey and Julia on the Trenches. 
  Salvemini came to dine, looking 10 years older since his feet were frozen in the trenches–and Madame Luchaire, whom he is to marry, and Gui the musician. 
No one had had any light to throw on why war in Germany isn’t declared. 
  Geoffrey dined at Sybil’s.
