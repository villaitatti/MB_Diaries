Geoffrey Scott
  Still in bed and still reading over those old letters. Bernard then, as now, passionate for reading. He dined with Sybil and Geoffrey with me, who told me I had the habit of flattering the men I was fond of, and every one remarked it about Bernard and thought it had spoiled him. Cheerful.
