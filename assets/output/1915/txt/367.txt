  I got up to lunch, but felt very very giù and went to bed after.
Examined myself the cook’s account–Ammannati must have been bewitched! They came to 70 a day. That is too much for 9 servants and an average of four people at a table, but still not so monstrous as 86! What could have happened?
  Madame Henraux came to dine, a really charming person, so poised and simple and sane and healthy.
Mrs. Baldwin’s talk is something horrible. She has abandoned all pretence at moralities and is absolutely cynical. BB is afraid to ask Sybil here to meet her. He thinks she w[ould] faint away.
