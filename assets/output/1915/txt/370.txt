  Mrs. Baldwin left, to our immense relief. I stayed in bed all day and did not even get up for a dinner to which Sybil and Irene and a couple of officers came. Sybil fainted away, of course into officers’ arms. She is having the time of her life.
They played games in the evening, and I ever glad indeed to be in bed. Sybil is one of the (fortunately few) people who invariably rubs me up the wrong way. Better not to see her.
