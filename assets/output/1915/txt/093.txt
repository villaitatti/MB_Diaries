Beautiful
 
  Mr. Gentner, director of the Worcester Museum (Massachusetts) came to lunch, and to see the pictures. While BB and Sybil motored I took a 2 ½ hrs. walk all over the quarries on Monte Ceceri. It was very beautiful and I enjoyed it in spite of being still bedeviled with “uric acid”. The Mugello mountains were entirely covered with snow and Vallombrosa more or less.
I enjoy walking alone more than with anyone.
Lance Cherry’s mother writes that he has gone off on active service, as a big Cunard Liner, not to France. This must mean he has gone on to the Dardanelles. If he comes through, how interesting he will have found it!
