 Thursday, April 15, 1915, I Tatti
Ray, Pippa, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent
 
  Mrs. Krayl and Cecil lunched here. Ray and Pippa went to the Pitti.
Mrs. Krayl has quarreled with Gordon Craig, who has made her choose between seeing no one at all but himself, or never seeing him again. He is half crazy with jealousy and embarrassment. 
  We all went to the Gamberaia and walked back. Saw the ilexes there with a view to the cutting back of our own infant grove.
  BB dined with Sybil and we revelled here and had gambling patiences.
