Fine, cold
Geoffrey Scott
 
In bed with cold.
  Giglioli came and said Cecil was the most valuable of all the workers in the Earthquake Zone.
Lady Enniskillen and Mr. Benn came to lunch, but I didn’t get up.
I did get up to arrive and receive the Dumonts (Consul) and a young friend of theirs, Miss Blazo of Providence. They stayed very late. Geoffrey showed the pictures to the young lady, who “adored” them all, all for the wrong reasons.
  BB afternoon at Sybil’s.
