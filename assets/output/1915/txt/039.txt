Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Naima
 
  Cecil took a 5:45 train to Empoli to eat a pig at the Ali Maccaroni fattoria near San Miniato al Tedesco - a yearly ceremony. They ate endlessly and drank ditto and he appeared here at 6 only to fall into bed!
  BB as usual called on Sybil, and I went to see poor Aunt Janet. Crisp was shot by a German “sniper” on his way from the trenches to billets on the 5th at 11:30, and he died at noon, hardly recovering consciousness. 
  Looked at Indian photos in evening.
