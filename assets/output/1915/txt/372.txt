Tramontana
  A young American art student named Judson came to lunch, and earlier, to ask questions about Simone Martini. He was precise and self-possessed, but unattractive. I do loathe Americans almost as much as Germans at the present moment!
  I called on Mrs. Ross and interviewed 4 cooks while BB took Sybil and her beloved Captain Peary a drive to the Madonna del Sasso.
I had made the cooks each write out for me a week’s menu with I prezzi relativi. That will give me some idea of their repertoire and of their extravagance.
  I got a dreadful “Hump” against Geoffrey. It has taken possession of me like a cross, morose and unfair “secondary personality”.
