  Mr. Benn and Edmund and Mary Houghton and Cecil came to lunch. We offered Edmund our little De Dion motor–a small return for the endless pleasure he used to give us with his in those wonderful first days of motoring!
  B.B. had tea with Sybil and I had a most glorious walk alone over the hills. Such a day! All the little streams came stealing out of the rocks with soft whispers, and a rushing brook at the bottom of the ravine sang a sort of ground bass to the other soft voices, The light on the oak-forest was ruddy copper and the sky made me almost faint with its purity.
  Cecil and Geoffrey gave a dinner to Mr. and Miss De Robeck and the Misses Hamilton.
