Rain
 
  Too rainy to go out tho BB went as usual to Sybil’s.
I went on with my article and had a splendid “go” at various odds and ends of work. 
  Alys writes that Logan has offered to go to inspect the Relief Work in France, to report to the British Red Cross. How awful if he should be killed, or even taken prisoner. He has become a British subject.
