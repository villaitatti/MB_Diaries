Warm, Dampish

  Continued the talk throughout the day.
We read BB’s manuscript. I feel as if it were those old old days when I used to get so wild with his lumbering careless elephantine style. I nearly weep sometimes in sheer despair that a person can be so bungling and clumsy in expression. It gets into one’s mind so it is awfully hard to rewrite in a crisper cleaner way–he has a Madonna “rising from the hips and emitting a radiance from her head”–
BB and I had a walk from the grove down. It was very beautiful and I enjoyed it very much.
