  Same foot trouble as 2 years ago after Brides-les-Bains–this time after Bath. I think it’s called Intertrigo. Feels like shingles. Naima trying Kundan Lal’s massage, i.e. bringing blood down into feet and holding it there while she massages toes, pushing it back and then massaging calves of legs.
  Read over our old letters of 1890-94. This amuses and interests me very much.  
  BB motored with Sybil. Geoffrey had tea-party of Mascha and her husband and Marcella Michela. He might fairly easily fall in love with the latter, but I hope he won’t as she is poor.
