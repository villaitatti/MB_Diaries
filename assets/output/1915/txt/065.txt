  Went with Geoffrey and Byba Giuliani to Donizetti’s opera “Elisir d'amore” but had to leave before it ended, as I went to the American Consul’s reception–a dull affair. The music was charming and Burci sang well. 
  Salvemini came to dine. He said he had not read the papers for 2 weeks, while he was working at Balsorano, and he was tremendously struck with the change of tone.
