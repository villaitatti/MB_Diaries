  Julia went to the Academy. After lunch we all went up to the children’s party at Villa Medici, which Julia enjoyed. Sybil, from being in bed quite worn out and ill, was dancing and skipping around like a crazy person, not still a second. It is clear that half (or more) of her illness is hysteria. She always faints into manly arms, then talks of it afterwards with immense gusto. Jiminy Whiskers, how I do dislike that young woman! I don’t even try not to now.
