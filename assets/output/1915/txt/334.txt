Sunday, November 7, 1915, I Tatti
Geoffrey Scott, Naima Lofroth
 
  A perfectly heavenly day–real St. Martin’s summer.
Grappled very unsuccessfully with accounts this morning. With several false alarms and mistakes. I must get Geoffrey to help me.
  We all far motored up to Monte Senario in the afternoon and walked along that delicious meadow on the ridge looking down into the Val di Mugello. There I called on Mrs. Ross and Lina. Found Aunt      Janet very depressed on England’s muddle
