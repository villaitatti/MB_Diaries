  Had to go to town–a great shame as such a lovely day. Dressmaker and furrier–neither of them ready.
BB called on Sybil.
  We are just buying a new property (to safeguard our view) which has houses on it, and BB said he didn’t mean to do a single thing to these houses, he loathed the people and didn’t care a damn if they lived in unsanitary conditions, and wished them all in hell anyhow. It is so silly. Of course if we own houses we must keep them decent. It gave me an indescribable feeling amounting almost to a sort of illness to hear such talk, such brutal selfishness and lack of responsibility and such unkindness. It took me hours and hours to get over it, though I said “it’s only talk”.
