		<p>Cold impossible - but it had to be endured.Costa and B. studied Titian at the Gallery.</p>
		<p>Janet came to tea and stayed for a little talk, in which Berenson compared the Jesuits’ way of roc[o]cofying the different architectures, so that they all came out alike, to their way of treating human characters. Janet appeared horrified at the idea of frankly enjoying people like pictures.</p>

		<p>We went to the Lichtenstein. I enjoyed most the Franz Hals - and the Verocchio and also the Savoldo.But it was very cold and I felt ill. I started to go home alone, but lost my way and had to come back, and was, I am sorry to say, horribly cross. It made me unhappy.Tea with Janet.Wickhoff called.Read Goncourt’s Journal.</p>
