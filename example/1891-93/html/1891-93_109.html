		<p><u>Hotel Roth. Munich. Friday September 4. 91.</u></p>
		<p>Went to gallery in morning and looked over the drawings. The only ones of note were the <u>Fra Bartolommeos</u> (especially a Head of a Woman), <u>Mantegna</u>, Madonna with an angel on each side; <u>Sodoma</u>, Virtues driving out Vices (analogous to Mantegna’s picture in the Louvre); some small Cupid pictures by Penni; a <u>Mantegna</u>, and a much destroyed <u>Pollaijuolo</u>.Afterwards we studied the Italian pictures. B. disagrees with Morelli on several points: 1. That the so-called “Lionardo” is not Flemish but Italian, possibly an early Verrocchio. 2. That the so-called Luini is not a Solario. 3. That the Paris Bordone Portrait is not much repainted. 4. </p>
