		<p>For a few days I forgot to keep a record - but the programme was nearly always the same - pictures, lunch, a rest, and Burke and Maude in the evening.Burke took us again to “Les Troyens”which we enjoyed even more than before. Bernhard developed his “Law of <u>Schock</u>.”</p>

		<p>We spent the day with Mr. Burke and his friend Mr. Irwick, first at the New Salon and then at the two Duran-Ruel’s collections. Bôcher was with us.The “Mikes” arrived in the evening, to stay with me, and after dinner came a dreadful letter from mother, urging me to go home and work for Frank’s election - !! It nearly broke my heart.</p>
