		<p><u>Monday May 8. 1893. Hotel Suisse. Rome</u></p>
		<p>We saw the Borgia appartments [<i>sic</i>] - but did not care much for the Pintoricchios. [<i>sic</i>] Few of them were executed by him, evidently.Then, while Bernhard went to call on a Monsignore, who offered to sell him his private collection, which would make him, if he presented it to America, ‘more famous than Washington’.Michael Field and I went to the Stanze and the Vatican Gallery. The Raphaels gave us little but pain and disgust.In the afternoon, Bernhard went with Miss Sellers and a party of Germans to the Villa Albani, and we went to S. Paolo, and to the graves of Keats and Shelley.We discussed Raphael in the evening.</p>
		<p><u>Tuesday May 9. 1893. Rome</u></p>
		<p>Field was ill with stomach-ache, and Michael nursed her all day.We met Miss Sellers and her friend and a German Professor (who is absurdly in love with Miss Sellers) at the Doria. The Velasquez is simply overwhelming. It knocks all the moderns flat.Then Prof. Klein took us to see some wonderful decoration from Augustus’ Altar to Peace - all the Mediaeval and Renaissance motives.In the afternoon Bernhard called on the Veddersand Mond,and Michael and I took a walk and bought photos.</p>
