		<p><u>Friday March 25. ‘92, 16 viale Principe Amedeo. Firenze</u></p>
		<p>We left Siena at 7.53 - a glorious morning.B. read “<u>My Trivial Life and Misfortune</u>” and I read <u>Creighton</u> on the train, and finished the 2nd volume.We reached Empoli about 10, and leaving our baggage we went to explore the town. The result of our search was a Lorenzo Monaco and a possible small Masaccio in the Galleria del Duomo, and a marvellously beautiful St. Sebastian in marble by Rossellino and some pictures (which interested Bernhard) by Botticini’s father.Then we walked to Pontormo, 1 kilometer away, and in the church there saw some (hitherto unnoted) Pontormos. We had some light pastry and Vermouth at a pastry cook’s, and then a plate of cold meat and some excellent coffee at the station, and then came on to Florence, arriving here at 2.30.Ray and Karin were delighted with their presents. Ray had a little headache, so I read her “The Dragon’s Teeth”-Then I went to see Gertrude, and found her no better. She has been going through various grapples with Miss Bliss and Julia.Emma tells me that Miss Bliss offered to take the children any afternoon while Emma wanted to go out. “Now’s your chance,” she said, “while Mrs. Costelloe’s away ---!!” Emma has found a young man, the chemist at the stores. He asked her to go to the Theatre with him on Monday and gave her his card. He is English. He said he had been watching for her to come back again. She is very much elated over her conquest. Julia has ‘fallen in love’ with the linen-draper in the Piazza Cavour. How funny the life of servants is!</p>
