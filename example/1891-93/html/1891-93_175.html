		<p>national note is the way they treat their tutor. Having hired him, they use him tout Ã  fait comme leur courrier<i>.</i> Tonight he had to leave his supper and take the <u>maid</u> to the train for Paris. And he is an Oxford man, far more of a gentleman in every way than anyone they are likely to know in America. They are true barbarians from the point of view of culture. He must be horrified a hundred times a day!</p>
