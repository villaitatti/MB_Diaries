		<p>gondola with Costa and his brother to Torcello, which was enchanting - and to Burano, where we had great fun with the children. The boatmen lost the way coming home so that we were rather late.</p>
		<p><u>Thursday Oct. 1. Hotel Murano  Venice</u></p>
		<p>I was tired, and unhappy - B. went alone to the Correr - with Costa.In the afternoon I had a swim in the Lagoon and we went to S. Giorgio Maggiore. What magnificent architecture! and Ruskin says it “is not worth a moment’s notice”-!We read Villiers de l’Isle Adam, “<u>Nouveaux Contes Cruels”</u>and “<u>La Révolte</u>” - also a <u>Russian Priest</u> by <u>Potapenko</u>. B. went to the Piazza and met Costa who had an article by Claude Phillipps on Morelli, good in manner but poor in matter.</p>
