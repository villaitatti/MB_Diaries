		<p>del Calcinaio. Even a short glimpse was a never-to-be-forgotten experience.We reached Perugia at 11 and after lunch I had my first glimpse of the Gallery - Then I came back and finished and sent off my Womanâ€™s Herald article on <u>The March of Ancona</u>, while Bernhard stayed for further study.We went to the Piazza and saw the sunset, and then went into the Duomo.Afterwards we hunted all over the town for a bookshop, and found <u>only</u><u>one</u> and a very poor one. The Library moreover is open only in the morning!!</p>

		<p>Bernhard wants me to write what I have just said - that I will always love him as much as I do now, and always want as much to be with him.</p>
		<p>We went to San Pietro in the morning, and the Gallery, San Severo, S. Bernardino, etc., in the afternoon. Enjoyed the Oratory of La Chiesa Nuova.</p>
