		<p>* <u>Tuesday Feb. 23. 1892. Florence</u></p>
		<p>Went to B.’s and looked over photos, and read Vasari on Correggio.In the afternoon I took Mr. Graham Bell to Gertrude’s, and then came back, and all the rest of the time till 10.30 we spent over an interesting and very, very suggestive piece of criticism of B.’s: the “inner law” of literature, the fact that it tends always to be a contemporary description of the struggle of the individual to assert himself against the forces that tend to hold him down.</p>
		<p>* <u>Wednesday Feb. 24. 1892.</u></p>
		<p>Washed my hair so did not meet B. at the Uffizi till 11.30. Looked at Andreas there and at the Pitti.Walked in the afternoon, and saw the Perugino and the Franciabigio in the Calza, near the Porta Romana. I enjoyed the Perugino very much.I read a series of conférences by Mme Marie Deraismes called “<u>Éve dans l’Humanité</u>.” It is not very good, though there are some good things in it.B. was to have dined with his friend Jenkins, but J. did not come.</p>
