		<p><u>Thursday Feb. 25. 1892.</u></p>
		<p>Saw the Andrea del Sarto frescoes at the Annunziata, the Scalzo, San Salvi and the Academy.I paid a short call on Gertrude.After my Italian lesson I went to B.’s where I had tea and read Huysmans’ wonderful little story called “<u>Un Dilemme</u>”.We walked and in the evening I read my children’s story to B. I have decided to call it <u>Linden Stories</u> or <u>Summers at Linden</u>. He was very enthusiastic, to my great delight. How I hope it may turn out to be worth while. I would like to support myself.</p>
		<p>* <u>Friday Feb. 26. 1892</u>.</p>
		<p>I went to the tomb of the Medici in the morning.Gertrude gave me her criticisms on our Correggio article, which she seemed to think very important, but I did not find them worth much.After my lesson we walked nearly to the Villa Careggi.Then came home and had tea.B. read Creighton’s <u>History of the Papacy</u>and I finished the first part of my <u>Linden Stories</u><i>.</i> B. thought it good.After he went, I read some of Creighton too.</p>
