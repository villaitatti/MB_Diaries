		<p><u>Saturday. Jan. 16. ‘92 Florence</u></p>
		<p>Finished the Venetians in the Pitti.B. went to see Costa and I to see Gertrude.He did not come to dinner, and I read Vol. I of <u>Yriarte’s César Borgia</u>.B. invented the word “<u>Pruritanic</u>.” He went to hear Le Barbier de Seville with Loeser.</p>
		<p><u>Sunday. Jan. 17.  92. Florence</u></p>
		<p>Bargello in the morning -Tea with Loeser at 24 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Bernhard’s room, after the two had been to call on the Ways - a proceeding which they compared to a Turkish Bath. Bernhard said that Mrs. Way sighed delightfully. Loeser was rather nice.In the evening I read <u>Layard and Crowe and Cavalcaselle</u> on <u>Lorenzo Monaco</u>, and Prescott’s description of <u>Charles VIII</u> in Italy.Missed Bernhard.</p>
