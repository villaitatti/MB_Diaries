		<p><u>Friday August 14. 1891.</u></p>
		<p>Read Motley going to Haarlem. Spent 2 1/2 hours in the Museum, studying Frans Hals, etc. We were perfectly fascinated with the two pictures nos. 77 & 78, painted in 1664- in a manner suggestive of Zorn and Carri√®re, but even more modern than either! Compared him to Shakespeare. Also found figures and treatment which Rembrandt must have copied.</p>
		<p>The best Terburg - a Family Group - was painted very much like a Courtois. A landscape by Van der Velde was like a Hampstead Heath scene by Constable - but better! The Cornelius van Haarlems were all </p>
