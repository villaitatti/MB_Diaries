		<p>fine, mild weather.The last part of the afternoon we spent in the Eremitani before the Mantegna frescoes.B. was awfully sick in the night.</p>
		<p><u>Friday Oct. 30. â€˜91 Padua.</u></p>
		<p>We spent the day at Vicenza, but did not have time to enjoy Palladio very much, because there were so many pictures to be seen. It was a day to be remembered by me, because I first became aware of Mantegna as a really great painter - There was also a fine Buonconsiglio </p>
