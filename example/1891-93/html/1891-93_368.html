We went to see the Pontormos in the Collegio Militare.I dined with the Carlisles. Lord Carlisle and Lady Mary’s husband, Mr. Murray, were particularly nice, although Lord Carlisle said that France had never produced a great man and that there was no such thing as painting now in Paris! It seemed awful to me to be living in such a rabble. Lady Carlisle ordering them all about, and fighting with her husband. O the joys of solitude!!Mr. Murray came back with me and came in to look at Perry’s History of Greek Literature.</p>
