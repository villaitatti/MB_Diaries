		<p>Santa Maria Novella.Worked over Lotto. Christina explored for herself. We read her our “Lotto”, and she confessed to having thought of Titian as a “sort of Dutchman.” Lionardo only suggested “a long kind of a Madonna and angel”; of Tintoretto and Botticelli she had never heard.Bernhard uses it to prove that art, particularly art criticism, is so remote from life that it is not worth bothering about. He is discouraged.</p>
