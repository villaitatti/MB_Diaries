		<p><u>Wednesday Feb. 22. 1893</u>.</p>
		<p>Aunty Lill writes one of her killing letters: after describing a boring lunch party of her own with a number of “swell” guests, she modestly adds “I know the occasion will be inelegant but the people will be nice”- Then she goes on: “I was to have dined tomorrow with Messrs. Moody and Tankey, at Hilton, but have given out. I try to embrace every opportunity to be with the spiritually minded - as it is Christ for whom I hunger and thirst, not wishing ‘the lower life’ as S. Emlen said last 1st Day, but the Higher Life. He said are you conscious you wish the Higher Life, but live often in the lower life” - which was a new way of expressing my own walk”-We went to the Bargello. I met Lief [<i>sic</i>] Jones and a brood of young Howards, and he asked me to come and call on Lady Carlysle. After a walk and some more Lotto, I went, and enjoyed myself very much trying to explain to her that there really is such a thing as scientific and reasonable art criticism. She regaled me with W. L. F.gossip, and grand talk about humanity.</p>
