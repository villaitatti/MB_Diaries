		<p>become so weary of her selfish life that she has decided to give it up and establish a baby-farm for poor children, with Miss Lowndes and other friends to help her - the “sisters” to wear a uniform, etc.! It is an awful blow, I cannot deny. The only answer we have to make to men who say that they are the only ones who carry on the world’s intellectual life is “O wait till women have a fair chance!” Miss Sellers’ chance has been splendid, but an intellectual life evidently bored her. For the one woman of her generation who perhaps might have become a scholar to give it up and take to an occupation any other woman could perform is a great loss. But who knows how much of it is due to her early Catholic training? A good deal, I suspect. Also it may be in part a diversion of the sexual instinct which seeks satisfaction in a sort of delegated maternity.</p>
