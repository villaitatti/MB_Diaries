		<p>Jesuits almost as much as Bernhard does.</p>
		<p>We were pretty tired in the evening.</p>
		<p>Today began the thrice accursed <u>Reign of Fleas</u>!It was a keen delight to see the Pontormo at Poggio a Caiano.</p>
		<p><u>Saturday April 9. 1892.</u></p>
		<p>Finished our catalogue notes at the Uffizi. Then we quarrelled a little, but not seriously. I called on Edith Kendall.Nana was dead tired, so I took care of the children in the afternoon, till Mr. Parry came.We all three went over photographs, etc., and Mr. Parry, English-wise, began to abuse his relatives, particularly his mother, and his younger brother, who is addicted to gambling.The evening was largely taken up with stupid business notes, but (after a quarrel!) we read what Bernhard had written about Tintoretto and Paolo and the Bassani. I found it excellent.</p>
