		<p><u>Hotel Roth. MÃ¼nchen. Thursday Sept.  3. 91.</u></p>
		<p>From Regensberg to Munich 8.18 - 11.45. Read Faust all the way.The Pinacothek from 1-2, just a glance at the Italian pictures. How lovely the Francia, and how matchless the Titian. Morelli compares it to the last works of Franz Hals. The Sodoma was delightful, and a small Correggio.</p>
		<p>We were both secretly dying [<i>sic</i>] to get to the exhibition of modern French (and other) pictures, so, after a rest, we went to the Glaspalast and found some of our favourites of the Salon, as well as some new ones. Three <u>Monets</u> there, and four or five <u>Manets</u>, besides a new <u>Besnard</u>and two new <u>Dagnau-Bouverets</u> </p>
