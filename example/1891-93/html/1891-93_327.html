		<p>“The Italians took <u>space</u> for a language just as the musician takes sound. The Italians wanted harmonious symphonies. They strove so to work upon you that the moment you entered a church you should feel the existence of space as a <u>positive</u>, instead of as a merely negative fact, as a <u>material </u>instead of as a void, and as a material capable of being shaped in the subtlest fashion. … Of course no architectural form can make you feel space so much as a dome resting on grand arches. These arches must be of such a depth that the moment you enter you are struck by the effect of space. If the arches were less deep, the dome would not look imposing enough, just because it might seem too heavy for its supports. To make the arches on which the dome rests so long that you do not at once seize the complete effect of the dome and the arches, is absurd; for all the extra depth is then useless, considering always that the aim is this effect of perfect space. Having the arches of more than the necessary depth is not only useless, but a positive evil. It came about in this way. The moment you enter a building you can’t help seizing the effect of what seems the whole. Now when the arches supporting a dome are so deep that your first impression on entering does not include the dome, as soon as you discover that the dome is the real point, and not the arches, there is a fight in your head between the two </p>
