		<p><u>Tuesday. Dec. 29. ‘91 Florenc</u>e</p>
		<p>Corsini Gallery in the morning.I called on Gertrude and Mrs. Way in the afternoon. She was so nice! Either she liked me, or she took me in. But at any rate I enjoyed her, and I understand the way other people enjoy her. She made me quite happy.We began to re-write our Titian article in the evening.B. had a cold. It depressed him, and he seemed to think we would be only fair weather friends. Ca, ce n’est pas vrai. Pour moi c’est pour tout de bon. He said yesterday that in arguing with a man you argued with <u>him</u> – with a woman, you argue with what somebody else has taught her to think.</p>
		<p>Karin said that Winny had told her that if she wet on the floor, God would write it down in a book, and then the Devil would come and catch her and burn her up in his flames. How <u>much</u> simpler to say wetting the floor is not clean!</p>
