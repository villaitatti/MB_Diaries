		<p>strength of it all, and the beauty of some of the episodes.Wrote my article on <u>Assisi</u>.Bernhard still reading <u>Burckhardt</u> on <u>Architecture</u>.Bernhard had a splendid walk.</p>
		<p>* <u>Saturday Nov. 19. 1892. Orvieto</u></p>
		<p>Cathedral in the morning.I was tired and rested and wrote all the afternoon, finishing my article, while Bernhard had another beautiful walk.The town rests like the Ark on the top of huge rocks. The Signorellis please me more.</p>
		<p><u>Sunday Nov. 20. 1892. Orvieto</u></p>
		<p>I managed to walk around the town a little to see the views and some churches and palaces, etc. Then we went to the Duomo.In the afternoon I sat in the sun on the wall, while Bernhard walked to the Campo Santo, etc.I finished <u>Gardiner’</u>s <u>Thirty Years’ War</u>,and Bernhard finished Burckhardt.I enjoyed the Signorellis most of all today.</p>
		<p><u>Monday Nov. 21. 1892. Florence</u></p>
		<p>Had a last look at the Cathedral before coming away. Mass was being gorgeously sung, with a congregation of three or four old women and men. What a contrast to a Protestant service, where everything depends on the audience and the newspapers’ report, so to speak. The Mass carries on the real tradition of sacrifice and worship. </p>
