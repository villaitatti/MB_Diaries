		<p>* <u>Hotel San Marco. Ravenna Oct. 14. 1892 </u></p>
		<p>Went to the Duomo and the Pinacoteca and the Museo Byzantino in the morning. Discovered an unfinished <u>Ercole Roberti</u>.In the afternoon we drove to S. Maria di Porto Fuori, S. Apollinare in Classe, and the Rotunda [<i>sic</i>] (Tomb of Theodora), and went to San Vitale. Bernhard then strolled around looking at palaces while I rested.In the evening I worked and Bernhard read <u>Burckhardt </u>on Romanesque architecture. I finished Vol. I of Morleyâ€™s <u>Diderot.</u></p>
		<p>It gives me a curious despair about the improvement in the lot of women, since I, who am (presumably) in the van, find it such a struggle to choose definitely between being a person and being a mother. I know that all that is personal in me, all that means self-development, real education, knowledge, enjoyment, is with Bernhard. With Ray I could not help sinking to mere instinctive motherhood, that is, with Ray and without Bernhard - the only possible present condition. Yet even knowing this with certainty, the struggle against the chains of womanhood - the <u>inside</u> chains - is a terribly hard one. Still, if laws were just to women, there need not be a quarter the struggle.</p>
