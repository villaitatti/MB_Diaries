They seem so uneducated, so little alive, so clinging to the one intellectual straw they have got hold of, that when you upset their hobby, or take away their straw, they cry out, as if they are drowning. “O what shall I do? What can I catch hold of?” They often leave Oxford as helpless, intellectually, as children, if they are honest people. Of course a great many get so well “trained” there that the last intellectual word is said for them, and they become successful lawyers, </p>
