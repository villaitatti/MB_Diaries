		<p><u>Wednesday. Jan. 27. 1892. Florence</u>.</p>
		<p>I took the children to school and B. went with Loeser to the Pitti.In the afternoon I took mother and Lady Albinia to the Academy - then took tea with B., walked to San Miniato, and read Mrs. <u>Jameson</u> on <u>Masaccio, Ghiberti</u>, etc., and <u>Crowe and Cavalcaselle</u>.B. wrote an interesting criticism on <u>À Rebours</u> - by Huysmans.In the evening we dined with the Ways and Loeser at the Toscana. In some respects it was amusing, but Mrs. Way ends by being “<u>assonante</u><i>.</i>” She can only talk in tête a tête, which is awkward in a party of five. Besides her interests are so very different from mine. She is Gertrude minus the <u>moral </u>sentimentality, an improvement, but then she is worse at least as far as I am concerned, because she is so frivolous; her amusements do not interest me. I should be content not to see her again.</p>
