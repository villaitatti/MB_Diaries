		<p><u>Friday Feb. 5. 1892. Florence</u></p>
		<p>Mother tried to mix in a little religion in Ray’s matutinal fairy story - and said “so they prayed Jesus to make her good”-“O, don’t let’s play that”, said Ray promptly. “Well, couldn’t they pray for the fairy to come and make her good.”“No, don’t let’s play that. Let’s play she just <u>came</u>.”Sensible child! May she always be of the same mind!</p>
		<p>We went to see many Ghirlandajos in the morning, and in the afternoon had tea at Loeser’s with Mr. Sumner and Miss Thayer of Boston.In the evening mother and I talked. Poor mother! Poor old people everywhere who try to make over young people’s lives according to their pattern - and poor young people! What an awful institution for hypocrisy and oppression the family is!</p>
		<p>[in the left margin] There was an old man of Dundee who taught little owls to drink tea. For he said, ‘To eat mice is not proper nor nice!’ This punctilious man of Dundee!</p>
		<p>Honesty is the one <u>personal</u> virtue, all one’s other virtues are questions of geography </p>
