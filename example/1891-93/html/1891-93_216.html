		<p><u>Friday Feb. 19. 1892. Florence</u></p>
		<p>Looked at Fra Bartolommeo drawings in the Uffizi and at the Andrea del Sarto’s.B. had a letter from Ned Warren saying that he could only give him one hundred pounds more, in the middle of May. It was a very nice letter, although it conveyed bad news. Still it is something to have that £100.Afterwards we came home and talked over our plans very seriously. B. decided not to leave Italy this summer.In the afternoon he went to see Mme Villari, and I went to see Gertrude.Then we looked at photographs  Michelangelo, the Ferrarese, and the later Florentines.We were both sleepy in the evening, so we did not do much except discuss our plans, which are indeed somewhat hard to arrange!I am reading an Italian translation of <u>Tourghenieff’s “Assia</u>”with my teacher, Mme Zucchelli.</p>
