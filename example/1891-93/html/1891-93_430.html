		<p><u>Saturday Oct. 21. 1893. Colomba d’Oro Verona</u></p>
		<p>Reached here 11.15 and saw Sant’Anastasia before lunch.My home letters were as usual very distressing, father threatening not to leave me any of his money.After lunch we went to the Gallery. Again the pictures looked crude and provincial, little enjoyable after Venice. But the town is divine! I read Spaventi’s <u>Pisanello</u>in the evening, and Bernhard Ranke.</p>
		<p><u>Sunday Oct. 22. 1893. Verona</u></p>
		<p>I was still unwell, but struggled out to the Duomo, S. Eufemia and Sant’Anastasia. Remained in and rested and wrote in the afternoon while Bernhard went to S. Bernardino, S. Zeno, and S. Fermo. When he came in he defined genius as a “<u>vortex of thought and feeling</u>.”Wrote and read.</p>
		<p><u>Monday Oct. 23. 1893. Verona</u></p>
		<p>I was ill, and when I struggled out to S. Nazaro e Celso I found it was too much for me, and I had to come back.Bernhard went to S. Maria in Organo and the Gallery.I read <u>Ranke</u> and an awful Italian book on the Veronese artists by <u>Zannandreis</u>, which Bernhard spent the evening cursing.At dinner we talked with some adherents of Murray’s Guide. One of them said, “Well, I like him because I know he is an Englishman, and I don’t like foreigners.”</p>
