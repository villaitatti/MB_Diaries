		<p><u>Sunday. Dec. 27. 1891. Florence</u></p>
		<p>A hard rain. I went down to tell B. I would not go to the Bargello and found him asleep at 9.30!We spent part of our day and all the evening re-casting our article on Savoldo.I read “<u>The Wild Duck” (Ibsen)</u> and B. his beloved <u>Ferrari</u>.I called on Gertrude, who says emphatically out of the fulness of her ignorance that B. is “a<u>ltogether </u>on the wrong track.” She doesn’t object to anything he does or says or thinks, but to his <u>Soul</u> – a thing about as tangible as the pre-Lockian “<u>Substance</u>”.Musgrave called on B.Read <u>Burckhardt.</u></p>
