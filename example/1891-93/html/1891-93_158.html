		<p><u>Monday Nov. 2. ‘91, Stella d’Oro. Treviso</u></p>
		<p>I was so ill that we decided to drive, and we went out to S. Cristina and saw the interesting Lotto there. Then we saw the false Giorgione in the Monte di Pietà, and after luncheon we went to Motta di Livenza. We saw a beautiful, most uniquely quiet little spot - with a delightful Church out of the town, approached by an avenue beside a stream. The picture there is a puzzle – is it Savoldo or Pordenone??Then we saw the Scarpa Gallery, and enjoyed some of the pictures immensely.We had dinner in the kitchen of a little inn, with the MOST BEAUTIFUL Giorgionesque hostess!!!! </p>
