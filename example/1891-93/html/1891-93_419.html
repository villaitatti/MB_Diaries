		<p>Discussing Catulle Mendèsover our coffee, Bernhard said his French was about as much like real French as patchouliis like oxygen.At night he described a pichirias giving you a slice of a man’s world, like a sausage.I came by post - 5 hours (4 francs) here - to this enchanting town. They walked to Longarone, then took a carriage. We found a splendid municipio of 1511 (Tullio Lombardi?) and a fine pre-Palladian church, and doorways, windows, shields, etc., salon.Yes, we are really in Italy once more!</p>
		<p><u>Thursday Sept. 14. 1893. xx Hotel BelleVedere [</u><i>sic</i><u>] Feltre</u></p>
		<p>A magnificent hotel here, with a grape arbour of Concord grapes from which we may eat à toute heure<i>.</i>We are on the track of that mysterious painter “Mat. da Feltre,” but have not got much further. I had a chat with some insane women in the asylum, through the window of a Sacristy that opened on their garden. The hotel-keeper says most of the patients </p>
