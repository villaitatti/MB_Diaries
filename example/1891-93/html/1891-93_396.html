		<p>Train to Umbertide.Saw the Signorelli -a “camera” was made to prevent our getting anything but a miserable two wheeled, rope-bottomed trap to take us to Perugia, but Bernhard saw through it, and in the end we got a nice phaeton, and came here in 3 hours, paying 15 francs.The Mikes were already here, and we dined together at the “Progresso”-</p>
		<p><u>Sunday April 30. 1893. Perugia</u></p>
		<p>Duomo - Belle Arti with Mikes - Perugian school failed to rouse us.A lovely walk after lunch. Wrote in evening.</p>
