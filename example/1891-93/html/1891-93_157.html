		<p>the Madonna - on a ladder, with a good light. How I enjoyed it! Unromantic as it sounds, I enjoyed her red robe falling across her lap, and her green tunic, the most of everything in the picture! They are not repainted at all, and how beautiful the lines of the drapery are, like the clear, nervous lines of sensitive orchid petals.</p>
		<p>Then we went to Treviso and spent most of the afternoon in front of the Savoldo alter-piece in San Niccolo. We also got a glimpse of the Titian and Pordenone in the Duomo. I was ill from the Rovigo poisoning, but I enjoyed myself.</p>
