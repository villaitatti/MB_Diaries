		<p><u>Monday Oct. 12. 91. Venice</u></p>
		<p>Met Costa and went over the Royal Palace, where we found, among other things, 2 <u>glorious</u> Tintorettos, and one of Titian’s loveliest things, a decorative ceiling painting in the Libreria, painted when he was 93. Then we went to S. Giorgio Maggiore and Santa Maria delle Zitelle.I was tired after lunch and rested. Then went to see Pordenone’s frescoes in the cloister of S. Stefano - done by him in rivalry with Titian, so Howells says, when they were both in love with Palma’s lovely daughter Violante!!Read Gray aloud, and then B. went to call on Mlle Jackowska.</p>
