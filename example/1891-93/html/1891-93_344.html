		<p>Despair - It is <u>so hard</u> to do anything which points towards giving up Ray, yet my position becomes worse each day. I live on in semi-concealment.</p>
		<p><u>* Thursday. Jan. 12. 1893</u></p>
		<p>At last Bernhard gave me the choice between retaining Ray at all costs or sticking honourably to him. It is true - it would be absurd to pay for a more than doubtful share in Ray, our whole happiness. Yet the thought of really giving her up, <u>cut</u> my brain literally like a knife. I never suffered such sharp pain. Of course I decided for Bernhard, and now I mean to do all I can to improve our position.</p>
