		<p><u>Sunday Oct. 11. 1891. Hotel Monaco. Venice</u></p>
		<p>Went to S. Marcuola, and S. Marziale, and then to the Correr. There </p>
		<p>we met Mlle Miranda and the Costas, who were charming, but who interfered with our work.Went with them to the Palazzo Reale in the afternoon, and then with Costa to the Querini Stampalia.Afterwards we took our gondolier (58) and rowed about in the sunset.In the evening B. went to call on Mallele Jackowska and Mlle Mercier.Read “<u>Contes Cruels”</u> and <u>Symonds</u> and <u>Howells</u> on Venice. They are almost worse than nothing. One gets very tired of Howells’ American drollery and “stuffing”, for his book has no real matter. Symonds </p>
