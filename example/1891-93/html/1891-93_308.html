		<p><u>Wednesday Oct. 5. 1892. Albergo Monaco. Venice</u></p>
		<p>Met Sperrys at 10, and went with them to San Salvador, San Giovanni Grisostomo, Santi Apostoli, San Felice, Santa Maria del Orto, and the Gesuiti. They are rather desolating; they want to get out of a church the instant they have looked about once, particularly the mother, who does not revere Bernhard’s opinion as the daughter does.After lunch we went to the Palazzo Grassi and saw the incomparable Longhis.They are such kindly comments on his own day, full of genial sympathy with all its amusements and foibles. There is no trace of haughtiness or sternness. He is in a way Hogarth’s double, but with sympathy instead of satire. His figures are all loveable, sweet, gracious, really aristocratic. As painting, it is really superb, and I know nowhere finer decoration. The harmony of colour is delicious, all kept in as perfect tone as a modern master.After seeing them, we went to the Carmine and the Scuola, and then home by the Lagoon. In the evening we all went out to hear the singing under the Rialto. It was full moon.</p>
