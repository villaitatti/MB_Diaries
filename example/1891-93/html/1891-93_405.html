		<p>here and wandered about the town and saw a picturesque Church service - At dinner one of those awful hidden, unconscious tragedies was half uncovered. Field so clever, so sensitive, so young, tied to a perfect goose like Michael, who can’t get a single idea through her head, and resents it a little when Field gets on, and at once takes to abusing poor Field, reminding her of all her past mistakes and faults. It made me feel very ill, the more so, as I was being violently eaten by fleas!</p>
		<p><u>Tuesday May 23. 1893. Loreto</u></p>
		<p>Saw Loreto.Bernhard made the acquaintance of Signor Gianuizzi and got a good deal of information about Lotto from him. He came with us to Recanati. The keys of the Municipio picture room had to be found, and then of the Chiesa dei Mercanti. All the town rose up in turmoil to find the ‘Canonico’ who had them in his pocket. At last they came, but it was dark. We saw however a <u>splendid</u> Annunciation by candlelight, and then drove back to Loreto by lightning and fire-fly light. White oxen pulled us up the hill.</p>
