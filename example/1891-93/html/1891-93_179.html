		<p>Went to S. Spirito and the Carmini and walked out towards San Miniato in the morning -Called on Gertrude.Called on Costa’s aunt, Mlle Miranda, and enjoyed their cordiality surprisingly. I felt rather foolish in going, for I have nothing in common with her. Costa came back with me and paid a call.B. finished <u>Voigt</u> and began <u>Ferrari</u>.At 7 went to Arezzo</p>
		<p>* <u>Wednesday. Dec. 23. ’91 Albergo Victoria. Arezzo</u></p>
		<p>Went to S. Maria del Pieve, the Duomo and the Pinacothek in the morning, and S. Francesco (Pier dei Franceschi frescoes) in the afternoon and a little walk to see the porch of S. Maria delle Grazie by Benedetto da Maiano. The architecture was just like Buonconsiglio’s, and <u>wonderfully</u> beautiful. The view of Arezzo through the arches was charming. This was a great pleasure, and it was a pleasure, too, </p>
