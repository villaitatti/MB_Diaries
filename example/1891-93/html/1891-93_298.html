		<p>saw the Missal of Cardinal della Rovere with miniatures by some painter extraordinarily close to the author of Lady Eastlake’s little pictures. Found an Antonio Vivarinithere too.After a rest, we went to the Cathedral.Wrote to Lady Eastlake after dinner.</p>
		<p><u>Saturday Sept. 17. 1892.</u><u>Varallo Hotel della Croce Bianca </u></p>
		<p>Left Turin 8.30 and reached Novara at 10.30. Saw the Gaudenzioin San Gaudenzio, and in the Duomo, also the Lavinis.Came on to Varallo at 1.10 reaching here about 4. Took a peep at the Gaudenzios.Bernhard was not so much enchanted by them as he was two years ago.I was rather disconsolate with sore-throat and general dilapidation.Bernhard read <u>Le Neveau de Rameau</u>and I read <u>Jacques le Fataliste et son Maître</u><i>.</i></p>
		<p><u>x</u><u>Sunday Sept. 18. 1892.Varallo</u></p>
		<p>Finished <u>Jacques le fataliste</u> after enjoying it almost as much as Sterne’s “Sentimental Journey.”Bernhard read “<u>Le Roman d’un Homme Raisonnable</u><i>.</i>He finds in the author, Potapencko, the influence of Ibsen.We went in the morning to San Francesco and studied the frescoes. Then we took a walk up the mountain stream, and I had a delicious swim in a deep green pool, and a sun-bath on a secluded beach.In the afternoon we walked out to San Marco in the hope of finding my opera glasses which I had left on a seat outside </p>
