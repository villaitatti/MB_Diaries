		<p><u>Tuesday Oct. 11. 1892 Venice</u></p>
		<p>My money came, but less than half of what I expected, which cast a gloom over our plans and over us.We went to S. Zaccaria to negociate [<i>sic</i>] about an old picture frame we went to get for Burke.Then we went to the Seminario, and I being tired came in, while Bernhard went to the Doge’s Palace.After lunch we went to the Academy.Then Bernhard concluded his purchase of the frame and I added to my book - which I shall call The Book.Read <u>Robertson</u> and <u>Eastlake</u>. Bernhard wrote to Maude.</p>
		<p><u>Wednesday Oct. 12. 1892.Venice</u></p>
		<p>Gallery in morning and Doge’s Palace in the afternoon.Bernhard sent off the frame to Burke after much trouble.I finished <u>Charles V</u>.Packed and wrote in the evening.</p>
		<p><u>Thursday Oct. 13. 92. Hotel San Marco. Ravenna</u></p>
		<p>Arrived in Padua at 10. Saw Santa Giustina and the splendid Paolo,the Santo, and the Gallery. Then Bernhard discovered an Alvise Vivarini, and I a Licinio. He also found that Speranza’s pictures (last year’s attributions) were done by Filippo da Verona, a sad discovery!Then we went to the Arena and saw the Giottos and came in by the 3 o’clock train, arriving at 7.30.I read Morley’s <u>Diderot,</u>written in a vulgar newspaper style, but very interesting.</p>
