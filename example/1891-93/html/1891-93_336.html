		<p>B. read an article on “The Next Conclave” to me while I arranged photographs. We finished our work on the <u>Quadri</u> and read until lunch time.In the afternoon Bernhard took a long walk with Mr. Jenkins, and they both came back to tea. Jenkins said a man could live very comfortably here in Florence on £50 a year!!!I finished Geymüller, and Bernhard lost himself in Burd’s edition of <u>Il Principe</u>.</p>
