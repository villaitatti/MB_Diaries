		<p>x <u>Tuesday Sept. 20. 1892. Albergo Italia. Bergamo</u></p>
		<p>Moved here for quiet.Spent an hour in San Bartolommeo looking at the Lotto. After lunch read our article on Lotto, rested, and went to Gallery.Finished <u>Oliver Cromwell </u>and <u>Liaisons Dangereuses</u><i>.</i>Wrote letters in evening.</p>
		<p><u>Wednesday Sept. 21. 1892. Bergamo</u></p>
		<p>Saw the Picinelli collection in the morning. Madame Picinelli was charmingly affable, such a lovely house, such pictures, her children, her own two nice daughters, money, respectability - I was tempted to envy her, but was saved by that spirit in us which makes us reason things about till we become equal to anyone.</p>
		<p>Then we went to San Spirito, and after lunch to the Gallery where we wrote a good deal of our article on the Morelli Collection.In the evening we wrote and Bernhard finished “<u>Les Liaisons dangereuses”</u> and I read Mrs. Creighton’s <u>Sir Walter Raleigh.</u></p>
		<p><u>Thursday Sept. 22. 92. Bergamo</u></p>
		<p>A very black day on account of our worries. But we did enjoy writing in the Gallery </p>
