		<p><u>Venice Albergo Monaco. Thursday 9. 29.92</u></p>
		<p>Saw the Loschi Giorgione, Christ bearing Cross - repainted but unmistakable.Then we drove up the Monte Berico and saw the Montagnas and the made-over Paolo, which is not so much made over as to have lost his characteristics.<u>Then</u> we went to the Villa Valmarana and saw the Tiepolos. This is the plan of the small villa -</p>
		<p>a Palladian building of one story and attics - a summer villa, with its small rooms decorated in fresco by Tiepolo, with the nearest approach to <u>genre </u>he could get. Louis XV, minuette <u>genre</u>, deliciously human and sympathetic even if fashionable. In some scenes he was very close to Longhi.The other villa at the end of the garden was filled with his frescoes too, the story of Dido, gods and goddesses, etc. The brush work in places was not unlike Besnard.</p>
