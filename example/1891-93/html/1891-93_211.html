		<p>Correggio article. In the afternoon we had a beautiful walk from Fiesole by Poggio and Vincigliata back by Doccia.In the evening Loeser came to dine with me and I talked to him about giving Berenson money. Loeser said some very stupid and some very unkind things, and many which showed him utterly unappreciative - but yet I cannot say that I did not like him in the end better than in the beginning, although I fear the result of my talk is practically nothing. What I liked was that he did try hard to be honest, and that <u>is</u> nice. Besides it was impossible for me to keep agreeing with him that B. treats him in a very disagreeable way sometimes.I said I hoped I would never try to make my children lead my life, and he instantly exclaimed  “O it doesn’t matter about them, they are both girls! – – ! – – –!”</p>
		<p>Who doesn’t at any rate unconsciously feel so?</p>
