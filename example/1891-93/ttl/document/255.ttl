A day of quarrels - alas! over plans and over the general tendency of children to engulf the personality of the mother, at any rate her intellect. I did a good deal of the quarrelling - perhaps all - but I thought better of it in the night. After all it is stupid of us ever to quarrel. We went to the Pitti and I got quite tired out.Loeser came in completely overcome with a set attack made upon him by Juliet Temple and her chaperon Mrs. Sumner. Juliet is determined to marry him - she told Logan so -, but she has too little tact to succeed. He was literally gasping for breath. Mrs. Sumner had evidently played about as creditable part as the “go-between” of a brothel.
*  Tuesday April 12. ‘92
We worked over Bernhard’s “Venetian School” and then went to the Opera del Duomo - a most enchantingly arranged little museum.We spent all the afternoon and evening on the Venetian School and even got a few pages type-written.Of course we made up our quarrel, and vowed never to quarrel again. If I could only learn to be quite straight-forward things would go much more smoothly. I mean to try, at any rate.Ray’s first metaphor: “Put a marker in your mind, Mary, to remember to tell me that story tomorrow.” """^^xsd:string ;
