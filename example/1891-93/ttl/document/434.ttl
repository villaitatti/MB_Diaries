Churches in the morning and Gallery in the afternoon.Sent off my article on Assisi.Bernhard read “The League of Youth.”

Robertson’s analysis of Gladstone in the “Free Review” seems to resolve itself into the conclusion that he  honestly  believed dishonesty to be the best policy. We saw some more churches in Bologna and came here. It was quite a “festa” when our old waiters and the oysterman at the Toscana saw us.My rooms have been changed and they want a great increase of rent. I liked them in some ways better as they were.
Wednesday Nov. 15. 1893. 12 Lungarno Acciajuoli Florence
Hunted for other rooms, but could find none.Went to Santa Croce.Came back, took these rooms, and installed myself.

Bernhard has gone away very cross and highly disgusted, because I refuse to make peace with him after a perfectly unwarrantable outburst of temper at me because I waited a moment to arrange my papers before getting another lamp when the first grew dim. I do not feel particularly angry, but I  must  find a way of preventing his using that brutal tone towards me without regret. He said he did not know what it was to apologize, and that being so, he must learn not to indulge in outbreaks of temper which require apology - Of course I know a momentary fit of temper isn’t the worst thing in the world, but it is only too easy for men to excuse themselves for such brutalities, and Bernhard is no exception.
