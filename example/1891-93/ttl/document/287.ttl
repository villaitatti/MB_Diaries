But I am sure he  thinks  he is miserable. Logan realized that it wasn’t his business, after all, and thanked his stars he wasn’t married. Afterwards he said it was ridiculous not to make marriages “on approval”- I said Frank was acting “nobly” from the point of view of old-fashioned literature, but  abominably  from the real point of view, I mean the contemporary point of view. He had absolutely no right to make my children Wards of Chancery without consulting me. It makes me indignant to think of it.

However, it may really be all right for them, because I realize that a young person like myself, in the throes of emancipation, is not a good education for very little children. Something settled is, I believe, better for them. At any rate, I am never to be denied access to them. But I am really too ill to think.
