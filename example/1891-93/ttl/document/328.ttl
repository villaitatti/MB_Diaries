    rdf:value """impressions. It will end in the triumph of the second impression, but one’s feeling of harmony has meanwhile been very much disturbed, and the effect should have been perfectly harmonious.
… Size beyond a certain point seems of as little importance in giving us a perfect effect of spaciousness as length is necessary to the beauty of a symphony …
If you seize the meaning of these few pages, you will see at a glance why it was that the great problem of the Renaissance was the  cruciform dome church . It had to be domed, because, as I have tried to show, the perfection of space is attainable only the meeting of four arms under a dome. The arms are the arches I have been speaking of all the time. It had to be cruciform, that is to say, the arms had to be of equal length, so that from whatever arm you entered you at once got the complete effect of the interior. No arm could be longer; in other words, no arch deeper.
… I have copied the rest of this elsewhere so I will not go on. I hope it has in it the germ of a very fruitful idea of Bernhard’s upon Renaissance architecture."""^^xsd:string ;
