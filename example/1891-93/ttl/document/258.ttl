I helped Bernhard pack for several hours, and then, on the way home, we stopped in to look at the Andrea frescoes in the Santa Annunziata.Mr. Hezeltine strolled through while we were there, doing his duty by Andrea by spending about thirty seconds before each picture. He went away looking wonderfully virtuous.Edith Kendall came to luncheon at 1.30, and we talked till 7. She was quite enchanting - a delightful specimen of America at its average best - a girl without much culture, but no prejudices - having been brought up a Unitarian. I really enjoyed her. We took a little drive in the Cascine, where the young budding leaves against the dark stems made an enchanting effect. Edith’s charm is that she forces you to tell almost no lies.Bernhard walked up to San Miniato with Loeser, who uttered the profound remark that after the disappearance of Christianity the cult of the Family would be the popular religion. It is about like suggesting that after Democracy Feudalism will come back.In the evening we went on with our “Venetian School.”Bernhard read Hennequin’s  “ Critique scientifique”  and found some of his own pet ideas foreshadowed there.We did not quarrel.
