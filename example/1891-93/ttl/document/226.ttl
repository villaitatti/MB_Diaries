We took our Perugino photographs and went to see all the Perugino’s here, including the Cenacolo attributed to Raphael, which Morelli attributed to Manni. It is clearly, clearly a Perugino, however.I took Gertrude a selection of photographs in the afternoon. She seemed worse.In the evening I had a  terrible  headache. B. was so sweet and nice; he sat by the fire and chatted gently, till he drove my head-ache almost away.We sent the Michael Fields his essay on the ‘struggle of the individual’ in literature.
Monday. March 7. 1892 .
We went to the Uffizi in the morning. It was bitterly cold.In the afternoon we grappled with something about Art which B. wrote last night.It is one of our special anniversaries today. A year ago we were at Haslemere. Florence Ayling was there too. What a dreadful year - yet how happy I have been. One  could  not pay too dear for such joy.
