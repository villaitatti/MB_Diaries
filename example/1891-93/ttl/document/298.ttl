Saturday Sept. 17. 1892. Varallo Hotel della Croce Bianca 
Left Turin 8.30 and reached Novara at 10.30. Saw the Gaudenzio in San Gaudenzio, and in the Duomo, also the Lavinis. Came on to Varallo at 1.10 reaching here about 4. Took a peep at the Gaudenzios.Bernhard was not so much enchanted by them as he was two years ago. I was rather disconsolate with sore-throat and general dilapidation. Bernhard read  Le Neveau de Rameau and I read  Jacques le Fataliste et son Maître .
x Sunday Sept. 18. 1892.Varallo
Finished  Jacques le fataliste  after enjoying it almost as much as Sterne’s “Sentimental Journey.” Bernhard read “ Le Roman d’un Homme Raisonnable . He finds in the author, Potapencko, the influence of Ibsen. We went in the morning to San Francesco and studied the frescoes. Then we took a walk up the mountain stream, and I had a delicious swim in a deep green pool, and a sun-bath on a secluded beach. In the afternoon we walked out to San Marco in the hope of finding my opera glasses which I had left on a seat outside """^^xsd:string ;
