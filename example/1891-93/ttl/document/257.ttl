    rdf:value """a reckless woman. It is a comfort to find the explanation of certain things in her conduct, and I think I have found it. She feeds upon “highly spiced” French novels, novels which do nothing but ring the changes upon the ecstacy [ sic ] of the supreme moment of sexual passion. This, I am pretty sure, is a fiction created by men novellists, [ sic ] who no doubt are taken in by the cleverness of the people whom they hire (in one way or another) to give them so much rapture for so much pay. So they believe women feel as men do, and even more. I do not believe it, and I think Mrs. Way is taken in by all this writing, and thinks there is such a thing for women to feel, and that, since she does not feel it with her husband, she might perhaps feel it with another man. Hence her keen interest in the subject, and her evident longing to have a lover.Huysmans, in  Un Ménage , describes such a case, and of course the woman felt no otherwise, before she had got her lover. Not loving him at all, of course the experience was dust and ashes to her. This really explains many more things in Mrs. Way’s behaviour than I have written here. It explains why she said several time to B. that although she loved her husband of course, yet he did not really satisfy her, and she felt that she could love some one else, himself for example, more completely and wildly.
