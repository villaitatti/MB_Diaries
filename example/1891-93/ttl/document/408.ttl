Friday, June 2. 1893. 14 rue de la Grande Chaumière. Paris
A day of travel but not very hot.
Saturday, June 3. 1893. Paris
Saw the Champ de Mars - and were disappointed. It must be Chicago that has taken the heart out of this exposition.Called for Maude Mosher and brought her to lunch. She is thinking of marrying a dissipated Southerner, but we tried to persuade her not. We went back and had tea with her and called on her enchanting musical friend, “Helen Hopekirk.”
Sunday, June 4. 1893. Paris  [Ray’s 6th birthday]
Louvre, Luxembourg - lunched with Maude. Saw the old Salon and were sick at heart.
Monday, June 5. 1893. Paris
Revised our Lotto all morning and it made us quite sick and we quarrelled. But when we read it to the Mikes in the evening it did not seem so bad.Met Maude at the Champs de Mars."""^^xsd:string ;
