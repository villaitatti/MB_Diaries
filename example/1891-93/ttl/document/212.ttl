Met Costa and Gamba at the Uffizi.B. went to see Loeser and they ‘made it up’- It turned out that the real trouble was Loeser’s resentment at the cool letters I made B. write last summer when I so dreaded Loeser’s joining us - or talking to my family about what B. had written. Well, I hope it is all right now.I called on Gertrude in the afternoon, after a walk with Musgrave, who came just as I was starting out.Tea with B. and work on our Correggio in the evening.B. enthusiastic about writing a Life of Vasari.
Thursday Feb. 11. 1892
Went to S. Ambrogio and several churches in the morning to see Cosimo Rosellis, ending up with the Academy. Logan sent his story, “An Oxford Idyll” for criticism, but it was really too poor to be worth it. I was horribly disappointed.Called on Gertrude and took tea with B.Wrote the Correggio in the evening."""^^xsd:string ;
