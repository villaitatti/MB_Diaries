    rdf:value "thing to advantage. The Sperrys were absolutely  desolating . They grow more so every time one sees them. Immensely rich, and travelling without taking the least pleasure in anything, they are simply the prey of all the human sharks in the shape of waiters and people with things to sell who cross their paths. Aesthetic enjoyment is utterly unknown to them. All they want to know is the subject of a picture. Their curiosity is insatiable, because it comes from absolute ennui and lack of interest. The girl is not so bad, because she is young. But the mother weights on her young life like the Old Man of the Sea. She won’t let her read anything but the things  she  read when she was young - Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Scott, etc. In short, the poor young creature is absolutely starving in the midst of intellectual plenty. Alas! How many mothers are like that!After lunch we went to the Accademia, as happy as larks to be away from people whom pictures bore. We never enjoyed the pictures so much.Then we came back and had tea, and Bernhard finished reading aloud Vol. II of  Creighton , while I did some sewing.Miss Jordan sent him some American poems -  “The Old Swimmin’ Hole and ’leven More” by James Whitcomb Riley - scarcely distinguishable from tame prose but for (so-called) dialect spelling and halting rhymes. There is no life in them.Called on Sperry in the evening and said goodbye to them."^^xsd:string ;
