    rdf:value """James really looked at things, and was very nice. Such an amusing discussion arose between them before the Botticelli Venus. One of us said how dreadful Vernon Lee’s criticism of it was, how could she find it indecent?“Well,” said James, “a Mother of a Family would  have  to think it indecent - not that it is, but it  is  perfectly right and proper that she should think so”---“If you mean me, my dear,” said Mrs. James - “I do not find it indecent, but I do find Vernon Lee so”-To hear their “my dears” and “my darlings” is, as Bernhard says, like finding shells on the tops of mountains! Then we lunched with Loeser, and I had a German lesson while Bernhard called on senator Comparetti, a friend of Mrs. Bywater.In the afternoon and evening we worked on our Lotto.
