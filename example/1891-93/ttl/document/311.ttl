    rdf:value """Tuesday Oct. 11. 1892 Venice
My money came, but less than half of what I expected, which cast a gloom over our plans and over us. We went to S. Zaccaria to negociate [ sic ] about an old picture frame we went to get for Burke.Then we went to the Seminario, and I being tired came in, while Bernhard went to the Doge’s Palace.After lunch we went to the Academy.Then Bernhard concluded his purchase of the frame and I added to my book - which I shall call The Book.Read  Robertson  and  Eastlake . Bernhard wrote to Maude.
Wednesday Oct. 12. 1892.Venice
Gallery in morning and Doge’s Palace in the afternoon.Bernhard sent off the frame to Burke after much trouble.I finished  Charles V .Packed and wrote in the evening.
Thursday Oct. 13. 92. Hotel San Marco. Ravenna
Arrived in Padua at 10. Saw Santa Giustina and the splendid Paolo, the Santo, and the Gallery. Then Bernhard discovered an Alvise Vivarini, and I a Licinio. He also found that Speranza’s pictures (last year’s attributions) were done by Filippo da Verona, a sad discovery! Then we went to the Arena and saw the Giottos and came in by the 3 o’clock train, arriving at 7.30.I read Morley’s  Diderot, written in a vulgar newspaper style, but very interesting."""^^xsd:string ;
