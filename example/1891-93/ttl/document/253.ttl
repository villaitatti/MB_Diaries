We were pretty tired in the evening.
Today began the thrice accursed  Reign of Fleas !It was a keen delight to see the Pontormo at Poggio a Caiano.
Saturday April 9. 1892.
Finished our catalogue notes at the Uffizi. Then we quarrelled a little, but not seriously. I called on Edith Kendall.Nana was dead tired, so I took care of the children in the afternoon, till Mr. Parry came.We all three went over photographs, etc., and Mr. Parry, English-wise, began to abuse his relatives, particularly his mother, and his younger brother, who is addicted to gambling.The evening was largely taken up with stupid business notes, but (after a quarrel!) we read what Bernhard had written about Tintoretto and Paolo and the Bassani. I found it excellent.
Gertrude is Dreadful. She would be  deeply  indignant, oh! absolutely outraged, if You said she was not intellectual.Here is a list of books she marked as the ones she would like to get from Vieusseux’s:
Life of Louisa Alcott
Letters of T. Carlyle and his Wife
Life of Browning
“English Life thro’ Yankee Eyes”
Florentine Nights. Heine
True Stories from Italian History Harrison
Social Diseases and Worse Remedies Huxley
-
The Lily of the Arno. Johnson 
Louisa of Prussia Kelly
Life of Edmund Kean
Vittoria Colonna Lawley
Love Letters of Famous Men and Women
Letters of Mary Shelley
Lives of 12 Good Men
Mary Queen of Scots and the Casket Letters
