In the morning we went through the Academy with Costa, and then came back and looked at photographs.The children went to Certosa, and we walked to San Miniato.In the evening we went over our Hampton Court catalogue and the article on Titian.My Italian takes so much time. I have no chance to read.B. had a bad headache in the evening.Ray came back disappointed from Certosa “because there were no monkeys”- She thought when I said “a monk would take her round”, I meant a monkey.
