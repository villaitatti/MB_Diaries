Lotto – Bargello: German, while Bernhard called on Costa. He found at the National Library that The Nation had printed his Stillman letter, with the information that it closed the controversy - as indeed it did. Loeser came to Costa’s and congratulated Bernhard upon it, but with a manner and look which betrayed that he felt very sick over it, and would give anything if Stillman had only had the best of it.After some more Lotto, I called on Lady Carlysle, who kept me a long time. I enjoyed it, as she asked me many questions about my studies. On the whole, in spite of her belief that I have a strong natural vocation for politics, I think I convinced her that I was not idle, nor likely to be a mere dead weight in the world.In the evening we did some more Lotto and read  Pater’ s  Winckelmann  - a rather disconnected affair - full of good things however."""^^xsd:string ;
