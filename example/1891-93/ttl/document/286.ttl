Bernhard in London - I at Fridayâ€™s Hill.
x  Monday, July 18. 1892.
I met B.F.C.C. at 44 Grosvenor Road. He said he had made the children Wards of Chancery. He said he had  proofs  of my adultery with Bernhard. I said that it was impossible, although I knew he might easily have what would suffice before a British Jury. He would not show me the proofs, but he said he had laid them before Sir Charles Russell.
I went away to think it over. I saw Frank in the evening, and told him that I found I had not the courage, considering my parents and the children and my own poverty - dependent as I am at present upon father - to insist upon a divorce. It is his interest, too, to keep it quiet, so we decided to make a deed of Separation.
I think it very likely that some day I will insist upon his producing all those proofs he speaks of, and, if they are really sufficient to give me a divorce, getting it.
Tuesday, July 19. 1892.
He made our deed of Separation and took it to read to mother and father and Logan, who had come up for the purpose. Poor mother was in genuine anguish, tempered by the feeling """^^xsd:string ;
