We saw the Cambio and finished our notes on the Gallery in the morning, and then drove here (12 francs), stopping at La Bastia and Santa Maria degli Angeli on the way. A lovely sunset, and such a beautiful view from the windows! But the dinner has been so awful that we cannot stay long here.
Friday Nov. 11. 1892.* Albergo della Posta. Foligno
The dinner was worse than poor, it was poisonous, and Bernhard was horribly ill in the night. We saw the town and the church of San Francesco in the morning, particularly the Martinis and Lorenzettis - Neither of could eat any lunch, so we had some coffee and drove on to Spello, where we saw the Pintoricchios and Peruginos, etc., and then here (8 francs for the drive).We found this a splendid hotel, cooking almost as good as “Julia’s” of Macerata.
Saturday Nov. 12. 1892 Posta. Foligno
“Did” Foligno and in the afternoon drove to Montefalco and hurriedly saw the Benozzos there. We must some day study this school to the bottom.A young doctor came in the carriage coming back, and was very interesting in conversation. He said the people here live on 50 centimes a day, Municipal and Professional salaries vary from 2000 to 3000 francs. How temperate the Italians must be!"""^^xsd:string ;
