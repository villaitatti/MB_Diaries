Mr. Burke arrived at 6. We went with him to the Louvre and to Durand-Ruel’s. There we saw pictures that made up for the poor Salon! Pissaro [ sic ] had made real advances, Degas is doing delightful landscapes, and we saw our first Forain picture, which Bernhard christened “l’Art et l’Artiste”. Burke bought it for 1800 francs.Then we went to the Champ de Mars and afterwards to Maude’s and had tea with “Helen Hopekirk” and some others.Read “Underneath the Bough” in the evening and arranged their “revised and decreased” edition.

Champ de Mars and Durand-Ruel’s.Enjoyed Islach’s wooden sculpture, “La Reclame.” It ought to stand in the lobby of the House of Commons! Michael made a more than usual goose of herself discussing Rossetti in the evening.

Read our Venetian article in the morning. Went to Durand-Ruel’s private collection in the afternoon, and there, while Bernhard looked at a picture by Culpp at their business house, which his rich American wants to buy, I bought toys for the children.We dined with Burke and Maude at the Alcazar, and spent the evening at Helen Hopekirk’s, who played divinely for us. Her husband told me that, taken all the year round, she only practises 3/4 of an hour a day. That is what it is to have brains and a good method."""^^xsd:string ;
