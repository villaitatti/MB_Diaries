Drove again to Recanati. On the way we bought some grapes of several intelligent contadine. They asked where we came from. “Inghilterra” - They looked blank “Non avete sentito mai dell’Inghilterra?” -“No, Signore, mai, mai!” We succeeded in seeing the Lottos this time and found them very interesting.We walked out to look at a wonderful view of snow mountains. A young woman with a baby followed us. We told her we were from America and asked her if she had ever heard of America - “Chi lo sa!” was her answer. We drove on here, reaching here about 6. The cooking is simply marvellous here! …Flea powder, applied lavishly, banishes fleas, but it is horribly dirty. Still I prefer dirt to fleas!

As it was a festa, the  whole  population followed us everywhere and cheered us when we drove off. I suppose they had never seen a female “forestiere” before. On our way back we took in Pansula, where we discovered a Crivelli!
