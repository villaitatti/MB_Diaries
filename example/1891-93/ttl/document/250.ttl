    rdf:value """was more Gertrude in the afternoon.In the evening we read Edith Thomas’ stories and her essay on Lorenzo, which she had sent for my criticism. One story, “Faint Heart” struck me as good. But the printed novel was Trash, and the historical essay poor to the last degree. It was an example of how a person acquires a reputation for learning by making a bad hash of a dozen (in her case it was about 3) good books. I supposed it made an impression on her relative because of the Mesopotamia sound of “Lorenzo” and “the Renaissance”. These words ring sweet in the ears of the semi-cultured, particularly in America. I wrote to her.
Monday April 4. 1892. Florence
More Gertrude rubbish all day. I must say I take Miss Bliss’ side, bad as she is. Gertrude is certainly responsible for a good deal of her badness. Karin was feverish, and I had to have Ray. We took her to the Ricardi Palace, but she “didn’t enjoy it very much.” A timely visit to a cake-shop, however, prevented the expedition from being a failure.I took tea with Bernhard, after a pleasant little chat with Lady Albinia at Vieusseux’s.
