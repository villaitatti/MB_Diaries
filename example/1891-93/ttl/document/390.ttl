    rdf:value """takes all my time and energy to keep him in a good humour. Men are all like that, I suppose” - a gentle sigh.We walked in the Cascine, I worked in the evening, while Bernhard called on the Forbes.“ Corso dei Fiori .
S unday April 16. 1893. Florence
Catalogue.Bernhard took Mrs. Bywater to the Uffizi, but he surprised me first by a very early visit to announce that his article on Carl Frey had been accepted by the Editor of the Nation and pronounced “very acceptable”. Also a certain Mr. Theodore Davishas written to him asking him to come at once to Rome and advise him about buying certain pictures - for a payment, of course. It may be an opening. We worked and worked and took a little walk in the Cascine - Bernhard dined with the Bywaters and Senator Comparetti.I dined alone at Doney’s. Their five franc dinner is a fraud!I read “ La Maison Tellier .”Bernhard is reading  Symonds ’ Vol. on “ The Fine Arts”  and I Vol. II of his “ Italian Literature . ”Costa came in the evening, stayed till midnight. He starts for Paris tomorrow."""^^xsd:string ;
