*  Friday Oct. 28. 1892 Aquila d’Oro. Matelica
(Giuseppe Amici, albergatore)
“Did” Macerata with the assistance of the Canonico Bettucci whom we met in his Church of San Giovanni. He took us to a little Church, S. Maria della Misericordia, where there is a mysterious alter-piece ascribed indiscriminately to  Crivelli  and to  Perugino ! It was almost hidden by a wooden case, but we climbed up and saw what we could, and that little looked like  Melozzo . This disconcerted him, as he has prepared a history of the Church which is all ready to be printed - except for the author of the picture. He came to see us off at the Station and presented us with a book he wrote to refute somebody who dared to deny that Tasso ever submitted his “Gerusalemme Liberata” to the Macerata Academy.We arrived here in a perfect evening, with bright moonlight. Unfortunately we both have colds."""^^xsd:string ;
