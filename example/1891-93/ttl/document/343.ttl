    rdf:value """Galleries were closed. Cesare, our waiter at the Toscana, says none of the country people who come in to market on Fridays give a single thought to abstaining from meat on that day. So much for the “religious Italian peasantry” we hear talk of in England! My heart was filled all day long with hatred and bitterness on account of James and his twaddle about Art.

Mrs. James is bovine.Bernhard had a call from Costa, and himself called on the Miss Forbes in the evening, while I studied German.
