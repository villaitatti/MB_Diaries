    rdf:value """coming back to the prescribed ritual after no matter how great eloquence of Methodists and such. The well-known form, the reserve and dignity, and tested appropriateness more than make up for the originality in the other - e.g., this is  my  comparison, not Bernhard’s! Then we went to the Baptistry and Libraria of the Duomo and saw the Pinturicchios and one of the books by Liberale. It was a delightful morning.In the afternoon we went to the Poor House (to see a Balducci) and to Fonte Giusta - and then wandered about and ended up in the warm loggia of the cemetery where we watched through a long afternoon the changes of light on the hills and mountains.I wrote the Linden Story and B. the sketch of the Venetian School for the Hampton Court Guide.
*  Wednesday March 23. ‘92 Siena
Went to the Municipio to see especially the Beccafumis. How surprisingly modern some of them are!Then to the Poor House to see a fresco of Beccafumi that Signor Frizzoni wrote to Bernhard about, asking if it might be a Peruzzi.Then to the Gallery, where we delighted in the charming Beccafumi - St. Catherine receiving the stigmata. Also the Paris Bordone. """^^xsd:string ;
