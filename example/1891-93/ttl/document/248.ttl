Uffizi in the morning. Bernhard met Mrs. Bywater.I felt very ill. We read and loafed all the afternoon - I went to bed feeling ill.In the evening we dined with Loeser and he took us to the Opera to hear Saint-Saëns’ “Sansone e Dalila” - which was really good.
Friday April 1. 1892 
Uffizi in the morning.B. came to lunch and wrote his Venetian introduction here, while I slept, again feeling ill. I had an awful headache during the afternoon and evening.
*  Saturday April 2. 1892.
I took the children to be photographed and then joined Bernhard in the Pitti.He had a letter from his friend which, after much discussion, turned the scales in favour of his going on to Paris. It made me feel very happy, for I hated to think of his missing the  Salon . It doesn’t pay to miss a whole year of the wonderful time in France. The decline is likely to begin at almost any time. O I am very happy to think he is going! We each did our own writing in the afternoon, and then took a short walk together. In the evening we went over our Mantegna """^^xsd:string ;
