Monday. June 19 
[20]
. 1892. Paris
We spent the day with Mr. Burke and his friend Mr. Irwick, first at the New Salon and then at the two Duran-Ruel’s collections. Bôcher was with us.The “Mikes” arrived in the evening, to stay with me, and after dinner came a dreadful letter from mother, urging me to go home and work for Frank’s election - !! It nearly broke my heart.
