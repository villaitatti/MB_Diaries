x  Venice. Tuesday Oct. 4. 1892 .
San Giuliano, San Salvador, and Santa Maria Mater Domini, in the morning. In the afternoon we went back to San Salvador and the sacristan actually took down the horrible affair on the High Altar and we saw the glorious Titian Resurrection.Then we went to San Zaccaria and came home and finished the Morelli article.In the evening we called for Mrs. Sperry and her daughter and went out on the lagoon in the moonlight. They are a pathetic pair: the old mother fancying she is living for her daughter, dragging her old bones about the Continent to please her which	 the daughter feels - “O, if I were only free to go my own way and be with people of my own age, how happy I should be!”"""^^xsd:string ;
