We went to the Ducal Palace at Urbino again, and to the Duomo and S. Francesco, St. Spirito and Raphael’s House, and the Casa Albani, where we found, in the midst of rooms of rubbish a genuine and most interesting  Savoldo . Bernhard went to S. Giovanni, too, to see some frescoes dating from 1416.It rained hard after lunch, but cleared up, and we started back at 2.30 in sunshine, but were overtaken by rain again.Pretty tired and lazy in the evening.
Thursday Oct. 20. 1892. Albergo Roma Ancona
Had a splendid light on the Bellini in Pesaro, and discovered two Bellinis in the Pinacoteca -- !! At 12.30 went to Fano where we had lunch. In the Piazza, looking for the entrance to the Teatro where there were said to be pictures, we asked the way of a well-dressed man. He took us to a youth and commanded him to show us “nostra camera nel Municipio”, from which we inferred that he was no less a personage than Il Sindaco himself. Our guide confirmed this and told us he was the Duca di Montevecchio. We found nothing """^^xsd:string ;
