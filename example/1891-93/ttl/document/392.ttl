    rdf:value "and I met “the Mikes” at their trains.He went to see his American friendsin the evening, as they have come up to Florence, and the Mikes came here.He came in later, and spoke against rhyme in English poetry, and of how blank verse so dominates our literary expression that prose is its mere bastard.I made two analogies, quite in the spirit of “the Master”.We were speaking of the mistake of looking for other things in painting in place of the primary  delight of the eye  - Bernhard said that all art was only valuable as  human expression .“Yes”, I said, “but in painting it expresses itself  to the eye , and not to the other senses. Everybody would think it absurd to  kick  a picture”- Then, when he was reporting to me Mr. Feilding’scriticisms of the Signorelli of the Uffizi, that such a scale of colour was never seen in nature, I said “You ought to have reminded him that he, who is a musician, produces harmonics of sound that are never heard in nature.” I repeat these to remind myself on dull days, that I  can  be witty!"^^xsd:string ;
