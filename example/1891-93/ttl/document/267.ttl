He did not like it much, and said, “È lo stesso di dar confetti a un bove.” The Volterra hotel was one of the best I ever was in (see Bourget’s “Sensations d’Italie). Arrived here.

*  Saturday April 30. ‘92 San Gimignano
We took notes in the Duomo in the morning, and in the afternoon walked out to a little Church about 3 miles out, called S. Andrea. There we found a fine Benozzo Gozzoli. The whole population of the village came in to the Church to watch us, silently but with determined curiosity. The little priest was too shy to invite us to have any refreshment. The walk was enchanting beyond words.We nearly finished our Titian in the afternoon and evening."""^^xsd:string ;
