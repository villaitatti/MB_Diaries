    rdf:value """write an article for the Woman’s Herald on “Pictures in Venice as documents about Venetian Women.” I enjoyed writing it.
Tuesday Oct. 18. 1892. Albergo Italia, URBINO !
We started out at 8 and reached here at 12.30 - a delightful drive. We lunched with an interesting party of Italian engineers who are building the railroad here. All of them had such intelligent faces, which showed the modelling of intellect when it is exercised.After lunch we went to the Palace of Federigo di Montefeltre. I feel as if no one  could  know anything really about the Renaissance unless they had seen it. But I cannot describe it.After dinner I continued writing my article, and Bernhard wrote to “Michael” to explain why women never wrote poetry and why they are beginning now. It is because poetry and wooing go together in the human creature just a song and wooing go together in birds. I believe this is the explanation, or part of it.
