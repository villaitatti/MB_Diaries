 Wednesday March 16. â€˜92 Florence
Met at the Annunziata - looked at all the pictures in the church, ditto San Marco. Then the Innocenti - Then we found the fresco by Raffaelino di Carli said to be at St. Maddalena dei Pazzi - but in a school-room near by. Then we went through the Museum of Antiquities. All this time we were rather quarrel-y.B. came to tea.In the evening we talked over what I had written. He was very nice. He promised to do the Hampton Court Guide for me. He said my feeling so, was about as silly as if he should fall into utter discouragement because I failed to get up much interest in the Florentines. The parallel was too good for me to deny.
