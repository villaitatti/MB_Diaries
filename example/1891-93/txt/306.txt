Went to the Accademia, and I re-discovered Bernhard’s Cariani,a puzzling picture called Martino da Udine. Wrote the Morelli article at intervals all through the day and in the evening.In the afternoon we went to San Rocco with the two Americans, a Mrs. Sperry and her daughter, millionaires from San Francisco.They were not wildly intelligent.Then we went to the Frari and afterwards saw the sunset from the Giudecca.

I was unwell.We met the Sperrys at San Marco and took them to the Redentore, the Scuola di San Giorgio and Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Then, after lunch, we went with them to the Academy.Signor Barozzi drew Bernhard into his den and had a chat with him, telling him all about Robert Browning’s Boston friend, Mrs. Bronson, who collected all the newspaper, etc., notices of him after his death - a pile many feet high. She also has the chair he sat
