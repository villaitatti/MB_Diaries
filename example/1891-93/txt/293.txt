 Friday Sept. 2. 1892. Paris
Louvre. Met two American school-teachers who were trying, without success, to enjoy a false Raphael. They had travelled a good deal with the feeling that they just missed the enjoyment they  might  have if they knew a little more.After lunch we went with Hapgood to St. Denis, which we enjoyed thoroughly, along with Bernhard’s clear explanation of what “Gothic” means.

I was unwell, but still we went to the Louvre about noon, and took notes on the remaining Florentines in the Gallerie de Sept Mètres.In the afternoon I read  La Débâcle, and Bernhard read Monk Lewis, “ Rosario .” Burke returned from Vienna and we dined with him.Read Creighton.
Sunday Sept. 4. 1892. Paris
Went to the Louvre, and Bernhard’s flock of myself, Burke, Hapgood and Jens Thiisgathered round him.We lunched together (all but Thiis) and then went to the Exposition des Arts de la Femme. We were interested in the fashions and coiffures, also some lovely Tanagras and Japanese things. Outamaro is as elegant as Parmigianino.
