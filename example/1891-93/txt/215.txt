We looked at Filippino and Ghirlandaio in the Pitti and Uffizi in the morning. Costa joined in. He seemed dreadfully depressed.In the afternoon I went down to write quietly with B., as the four children and smoky fires made it quite uninhabitable here. But Loeser came in and had tea and interrupted us.We worked further on the Correggio in the evening, and I began to write childrenâ€™s stories. If they are successful, I ought to be able to support myself by them.

Fra Bartolommeo, Granacci, Ridolfo Ghirlandaio in the morning - also Raffaelo Botticini.We lunched with Loeser, who gave us a capital lunch.Musgrave came in the afternoon and while B. read Herrick,he dictated to me the first  Canti  of his translation of Dante, which I did for him on the type-writer.We looked at photographs, and B. almost decided that the so-called Signorelli fresco in the Sistine Chapel is by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. Finished our Correggio and sent it off to Cram. I wrote more of my story.
