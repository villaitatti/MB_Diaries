him furiously raging over Vernon Lee’s “Vanitas” which contains a complete microscopic dissection of his brother the novelist, “the most incomprehensible, indelicate, indecent thing conceivable.” All this sounded odd from the brother of the man whose “Miss Birdseye” was such a patent caricature of his father’s old friend, Miss Peabody.
In the evening we read “ Rosmersholm ” and I read “Hedda Gabler”.
Thursday March 9. 1893.
Went to the Uffizi and studied Florentine drawings.Worked on the Lotto. Finished Rosmersholm and compared it with Solness - Bernhard called on the Scotts and I went to San Miniato.After tea we grappled with the Lotto, and quarrelled, as usual when we write together! in the evening read “ Vanitas ,” which didn’t strike us as very bad. I also read the other two stories, one at night, and the other in morning.
