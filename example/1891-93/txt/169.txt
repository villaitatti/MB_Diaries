* Wednesday Nov. 25. ‘91 Vienna
Went to the gallery in the morning and called on two of the directors. Herr Frümel was a pleasant little man, embarrassing in his shyness, but very kind and helpful. He spoke excellent literary French, rather slowly, as if he were turning over the leaves of the dictionary in his head.We saw an unexposed picture, a large Adoration of the Magi, by Jacopo and his son Francesco Bassano. In the evening we quarrelled because B. wouldn’t write, but finally we began an article on the galleries in the smaller towns near Venice.
