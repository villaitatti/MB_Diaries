the Opera del Duomo.We worked on our  Quadri  and nearly brought it up to date.I began  Geymüller ’s book on  Bramante and St. Peter’s . Bernhard is reading Machiavelli’s  Storia Fiorentina  and also the  Sacco di Roma ,  both of which he says are simply fascinating.

B. read an article on “The Next Conclave” to me while I arranged photographs. We finished our work on the  Quadri  and read until lunch time. In the afternoon Bernhard took a long walk with Mr. Jenkins, and they both came back to tea. Jenkins said a man could live very comfortably here in Florence on £50 a year!!! I finished Geymüller, and Bernhard lost himself in Burd’s edition of  Il Principe .
