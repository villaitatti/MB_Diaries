enjoyed Monet, Manet, and Besnard most of all. We also looked at Böcklin and his school. It was worth coming to Munich if to see nothing but the Monets.After the Exhibition, we went back to Haufstängl’s and bought some photographs. Then came back, and while I read  Faust , B. wrote a few pages about the Augustan marbles - which I criticised savagely before going to dinner.
