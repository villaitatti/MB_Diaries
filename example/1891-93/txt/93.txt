Tschudi’s study.
Herr Klinsmann took us to the International Exhibition, where there were paintings by every school but the only good one, the French. Böcklin had an absurd “Susanna and the Elders”, as modern old ___ Jews. Berenson said he would like to see the Bible illustrated by Böcklin. The Spanish painters struck me as delightful, particularly Villegas and Beuliure y Gil.
