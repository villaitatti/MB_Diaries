Hotel Roth. Munich. Saturday Sept.  5 91
We took the 7 o’clock train to Augsburg. I read Faust all the way.Wandered about the town and saw the Cathedral. The stained glass windows of the 11 th  century mentioned by Baedeker exist only in his imagination. Cathedral filled with altar-pictures by German masters, best seemed to be by Burckmayer. At 9 went to the gallery and looked at the Italian pictures there. The most beautiful was a Tintoretto.
