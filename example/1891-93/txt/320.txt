*  Wednesday Oct. 26. 1892. Albergo Milano. Macerata
Drove to  Cingoli,  missing our way and passing through  Arpignano  and  Arulane . A fearfully steep climb to Cingoli, which is on one of the highest spurs of the Appenines. From the town wall we saw about a fourth of the whole Adriatic coast, a superb panorama. It makes it so enchanting too, to have each hill crowned with an old fortified town - and to be sure that each one holds beautiful palaces, interesting historical relics of all kinds, and perhaps marvellous pictures.Cingoli, a deserted, inaccessible place, has a magnificent Palace, Egidio of Viterbo (1531) on the Piazza, and in the Church a Lotto --!! We spent an hour and a half in rapture before it. It was hard to come away - The little Albergo there (Via Cavour) seemed nice. We had a good lunch of eggs and sausages and veal and fruit and a glass of Marsala and coffee for 85 centimes each!!

Niccolo in the Church - also fine cloisters.The “Triumphal Arch” guide books are so loud in praise of, does not exist, nor has ever existed! It is the portal of the church, put up by Nicola Piccinino. Now having come to such an out-of-the-way spot to verify the original mis-translation from XV century Latin, the legend of the Triumphal
