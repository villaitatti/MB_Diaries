so calmly conscious of superiority. The truth is our “spheres”, though neither of them domestic, are so utterly different that we haven’t the slightest desire, either one of us, to shine in the other’s sphere. I am afraid she interests me no more. I believe it was stupid of me to say I would go to see her. Still I will do my best. What interested me most was to see that even a person like B. was not shocked with such arrant flirtatiousness, but on the contrary rather pleased with it. I suppose such a thing as instinctive “male vanity” does not exist in every man. Well, I can’t be jealous of her. I believe even if he should “fall in love” with her I could not now be really jealous.
We read “ Candide ”today and some of the new Revues Bleues,and B. read Crowe and Cavalcaselle on Giotto.Last night up till one o’clock we read  Vasari’s Life of Titian .
