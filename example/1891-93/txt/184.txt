 Sunday. Dec. 27. 1891. Florence
A hard rain. I went down to tell B. I would not go to the Bargello and found him asleep at 9.30!We spent part of our day and all the evening re-casting our article on Savoldo.I read “ The Wild Duck” (Ibsen)  and B. his beloved  Ferrari . I called on Gertrude, who says emphatically out of the fulness of her ignorance that B. is “a ltogether  on the wrong track.” She doesn’t object to anything he does or says or thinks, but to his  Soul  – a thing about as tangible as the pre-Lockian “ Substance ”.Musgrave called on B.Read  Burckhardt.
