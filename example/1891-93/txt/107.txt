 Hotel Roth. MÃ¼nchen. Thursday Sept.  3. 91.
From Regensberg to Munich 8.18 - 11.45. Read Faust all the way. The Pinacothek from 1-2, just a glance at the Italian pictures. How lovely the Francia, and how matchless the Titian. Morelli compares it to the last works of Franz Hals. The Sodoma was delightful, and a small Correggio.
We were both secretly dying [ sic ] to get to the exhibition of modern French (and other) pictures, so, after a rest, we went to the Glaspalast and found some of our favourites of the Salon, as well as some new ones. Three  Monets  there, and four or five  Manets , besides a new  Besnard and two new  Dagnau-Bouverets
