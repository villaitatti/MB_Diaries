of cholera. I sent for the doctor, who came and found it nothing but a severe cold in the bowels. After his medicine, the pain passed away. In spite of his weakness we went to the Santa, the Cappella of S. Giorgio, and the Scuola del Santo and Carmine, and after lunch to the Arena Chapel. I am afraid we did not find the “sweep of the brush” so enchanting as we did two years ago, considering that it is mostly very obvious re-paint! What could have got into our eyes?! Then we drove (5 francs but we gave him 6) to  Praglia ,an abandoned monastery of the greatest grandeur and beauty. There was cloister upon cloister, with arches supported on beautiful pillars, a dainty little church from Tullio Lombardi’s designs. Magnificent last century stair cases and wood-work, a fresco by Mantegna; in short, a place we would not have missed for anything.In the evening, after a pleasant little call from the doctor, I finished  Vol. II of Ranke’s Reformation , and did some writing, while Bernhard read his  Mantova e Urbino .
