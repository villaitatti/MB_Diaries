The date to pass the Home Rule Bill! Norman Hapgood’s brother, Hutchins Hapgood, suddenly turned up. The first we heard of him was that he was sound asleep in the room next to mine. We met him at the Glyptothek.In the evening we went to the  Götterdämmerung  and enjoyed it best of all. Still, Wagner does need condensing. Five hours  is  too long.
