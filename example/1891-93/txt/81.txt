interesting, and the pictures by Jan de Braij, while under Frans Halsâ€™ influence, were very good. A Regents picture by  Pot  was also extremely good, and some portraits by Verspronck. 
Compared evolution of Hals to Velasquez, beginning where Titian left off.
Went to Fodor Museum - an absolute fraud, 1 small Meissonier and a slight sketch 
by Watteau.
Walked through Ghetto.

A day in train from Amsterdam 9.30 to Hanover 8.50. Missed connections. Very hot and somewhat dusty.
