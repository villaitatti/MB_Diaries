 Sunday Oct. 11. 1891. Hotel Monaco. Venice
Went to S. Marcuola, and S. Marziale, and then to the Correr. There 
we met Mlle Miranda and the Costas, who were charming, but who interfered with our work.Went with them to the Palazzo Reale in the afternoon, and then with Costa to the Querini Stampalia. Afterwards we took our gondolier (58) and rowed about in the sunset. In the evening B. went to call on Malle le  Jackowska and Mlle Mercier.Read “ Contes Cruels”  and  Symonds  and  Howells  on Venice. They are almost worse than nothing. One gets very tired of Howells’ American drollery and “stuffing”, for his book has no real matter. Symonds
