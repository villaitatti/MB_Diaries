 Thursday Nov. 2. 1893. Capello. Brescia
Missed the train to Medole, so spent a delightful day seeing the churches.At S. Clemente we got into a quarrel with the custode and the parroco, and at the end came to mutual vituperation. “Senza Creanza” was the last word hurled at us as we disappeared round the corner. Bernhard read  Il Cortigiano and I wrote in the evening.Found  bianca riviera  an  excellent  white wine.
Friday Nov. 3. 1893 . Brescia
Spent 2 1/4 hours going to Medole, five minutes look at the fine Titian there, and 2 1/4 hours coming back! I read “Modern Painters” and Bernhard the  Cortigiano . Found the Café Centrale a good place to eat at, after having been driven from all the other places by overcharges or bad service. This place very cheap, clean, and quiet.Went to Paitone in the afternoon, and rushed up to the Santuario to see the wonderful Moretto. Bernhard had a sort of heart attack from hurrying.Dined at cafe.  Sussago rosso  (vecchio) a splendid red wine. Wrote an article in the evening about the day’s adventure.

Wrote that they reveled [ sic ] in scenes and incidents which he was
