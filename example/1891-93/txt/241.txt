*  Friday March 18. 1892. Pensione TognazziSiena
We came over to Siena. The journey took 5 hours - from 9 till 2! In the afternoon we walked about the town, and sat in the Cemetery. The first impression of the Piazza is a thing never to be forgotten in any detail. I feel at home with these marvellous views. They remind me of the great stretches of blue mountains and rather bare plain I knew in the West.In the evening B. read  Layard  and I read  Là Bas .
Saturday March 19. 1892 Siena
S. Francesco, S. Domenico and the Gallery in the morning.After lunch we strolled out and looked at the Raffaelino di Fiorenza (Croli?) of Santa Maria dei [ sic ] Angeli.Then we wandered on and on over the hills, entranced with the view. We had a marvelous view from a high hill opposite. The ways were so winding that it took us twice as long to get home as we expected, and I got rather tired. But a Vermouth and some nice cakes freshened us up.I finished  Là Bas  in the evening, and at half past 8 (!) we dropped asleep from sheer exhaustion. We slept till 6.30.
