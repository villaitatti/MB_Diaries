Saturday. Jan. 16. ‘92 Florence
Finished the Venetians in the Pitti.B. went to see Costa and I to see Gertrude.He did not come to dinner, and I read Vol. I of  Yriarte’s César Borgia . B. invented the word “ Pruritanic .” He went to hear Le Barbier de Seville with Loeser.
Sunday. Jan. 17.  92. Florence
Bargello in the morning -Tea with Loeser at 24 Lungarno Acciajuoli, Bernhard’s room, after the two had been to call on the Ways - a proceeding which they compared to a Turkish Bath. Bernhard said that Mrs. Way sighed delightfully. Loeser was rather nice.In the evening I read  Layard and Crowe and Cavalcaselle  on  Lorenzo Monaco , and Prescott’s description of  Charles VIII  in Italy. Missed Bernhard.
