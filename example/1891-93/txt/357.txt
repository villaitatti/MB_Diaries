genuine the “Fortezza”, “Judith” and “Adoration” in the Uffizi, and the St. Sebastian of Berlin, and Bernhard claiming, and I think proving, that these are early works. Costa seemed half convinced.We had a glorious drive round by Carreggi [ sic ], Terzollino, Trespiano and the Via Bolognese and then Bernhard left a card on Sen. Comparetti.Mrs. James called on me, and Costa and Bernhard came in before she went.Bernhard invented the word “magazining” for hasty reading.Prof. Wickhoffof Vienna has published two articles in the Journal des Beaux Arts about the Vienna Gallery which are simply the notes he took down of what Bernhard said, even to the aesthetic criticism! The worst of it is he has never mentioned his name.
Wednesday Feb. 8. 1893. 
Work on Lotto and Botticellis in the Uffizi in the morning. After more work, we went out for a walk and picked up Loeser, who seemed to be in poor health. He took us in to have tea at Giacosa’s. He is nice when he doesn’t tell lies, and his ill-health makes him pathetic.In the evening Bernhard’s head ached, so I read aloud the  Life of Sir Charles Eastlake .Born 100 years go, and I know his wife!
