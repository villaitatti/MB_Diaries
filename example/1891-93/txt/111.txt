After the gallery we visited the other Churches and looked at the picturesque parts of the town. Then had an excellent lunch at the “Grün Haus” and came back by a slow train, sleeping and reading Villiers de Lisle Adam’s “ Le Secret de l’Échafaud.” Tried to re-write Correggio article.
Hotel Roth. Munich. Sunday Sept.  6. 91.
Went to the Pinacothek and studied and noted the Venetian and Veronese paintings. Visited the various Brauereis in the evening, but they were so smoky that even the music did not tempt us to stay. As it was a Volksfest, a cold rain was falling all day. God is evidently as undemocratic here as in England!
