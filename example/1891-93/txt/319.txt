Ray, and it seems as if I  could  not give her up. I know so clearly in my mind all that is to be said, and I realize how clinging to her will make me unhappy and worse still Bernhard, and won’t do her much (if any) good - Yes, I see it all as clearly as a mathematical problem, I fear. Yet I cannot - ! This struggle going on from day to day is very painful. Yet after I cut it, I know it will be far more painful. Bernhard’s patience is giving out, too, I can see so well. He finds almost everything I do amiss, and shows at every moment his contempt for the feeling I have for Ray which he thinks is mere brute instinct, simply killing my personality. He said if I gave her up he would be prepared for my being unhappy a long time, but eventually getting over it. Alas! I am sure he would not have the patience to bear with me during that time. It is very natural he should feel so. He has no family ties, life is full of all sorts of marvellous possibilities for him, and a great deal is spoiled because of my mistake, because of my child, whom he thinks a rather detestable specimen of humanity in herself.
Thus are we entered upon that stormy era which in matrimony usually precedes shipwreck, where one wishes and natural inclinations pull different ways, and where we begin to “get on each other’s nerves” - Alas, I do love him so!
