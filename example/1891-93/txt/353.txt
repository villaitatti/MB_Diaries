from the Bagni di Ripoli, a lovely walk.
Sunday. Jan. 29. 1893. 
Lotto in the morning, and Bargello.I had an attack of pleurisy, so I rested while Bernhard walked over Bello Sguardo. After tea we finished correcting our Lotto. Had dinner sent in, and read Pater’s “School of Giorgione”and talked about it in the evening. As Bernhard says, he writes as if he had a cold in his head - ‘molto costipato’ - He is never clear, but is just on the point of clearing himself out.Read Ben Jonson.
