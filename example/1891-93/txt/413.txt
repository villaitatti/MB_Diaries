Sunday Aug. 20. 1893. Hotel Roth. Munich
Gallery again - still rather depressing. Discovered a Cariani and 2 Giulio Campis, etc.Wandered in the lovely parks.Left for Munich at 1.54. Went out at Ulm to see the Cathedral and missed the train. Stopped our luggage by telegram at one of the stations, and had a couple of hours to see the town, before taking a train to rejoin it.Reached Munich 10.30.
Monday Aug. 21. 1893. Munich
Changed rooms. They have  no blinds  in this hotel and the light enters at 4! Went to the Gallery, and to hear “ Die Walküre ” in the evening. Decided that it needs condensing - except the last act. I noticed a “digestion motif” which I think no one has pointed out. It occurs when Sigmund drinks, and represents the bier [ sic ] gurgling down his throat and rumbling about in his stomach and intestines!
