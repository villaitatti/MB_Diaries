the afternoon we walked and semi-quarrelled about walking (which I  hate ), but made up.Then I took a nap while B. read Creighton’s “ History of the Papacy ,” and then I type-wrote half of my story.Alas! that time is so short. I had a hundred other things I wanted to do in the day - but I went to bed at 11  very  tired.
Monday Feb. 29. 1892.
(Where will we be on the next 29th of February? Together, at any rate.) Met at S. Lorenzo and looked at Rosso and Bronzino and Sogliani, and the Donatello altars. The Library was closed. Costa came late, but we met him on our way out and we went to the Gallery connected with Santa Maria Nuova. The Hugo van du Goes impressed me very much.Then we went to the Academy to look for a Lorenzo Monaco mentioned by Crowe and Cavalcaselle - Milanese. Then I came home and had my lesson and went to see Gertrude. She says she only reads when she really has nothing else to enjoy. That would be entirely praiseworthy if she did not at the same time pose as a “cultured” person and venture upon literary criticisms.B. came to tea and read Creighton while I finished type-writing my story.
