 Sunday Sept. 25. 1892. Hotel Metropole. Genoa.
Last look at Gallery -Bernhard found “Vernon Lee’s” card. We must have seen her in the Gallery, a fright, but seeming rather intelligent about the pictures.I found a letter from Lady Eastlake.We came to Genoa, hoping to find an Esposizione di Quadri Antichi to repay us.
Monday Sept. 26. 1892 Genoa.
Went to the Brignole - Sale Gallery and found some Paris Bordones. Saw the Municipio.Met Signor Barozzi of Venice at the Esposizione. We found very few things there to reward our journey, perhaps a portrait by Bartolommeo Veneto was the only other thing we would not naturally have seen whenever we came here. In the afternoon I wrote to Mr. Arford, my solicitor, sending him some questions for Counsel’s opinion.Then we went to the Palazzo Marcelli-Durazzo, and found nothing, but a fine stair-case and Guidos and Rubens, etc. Then to the Balbi-Senegara and found an overwhelming Titian - marvellously beautiful - worth any journey!Afterwards we saw the sunset from the town of S. Maria di Carignano.Wrote in evening. Read  Charles V .
