I awoke at 6.30 and saw the glorious hills and mountains in the early morning mist and the brilliant sunshine.We had breakfast at 8.30 and then went out to the Municipio where we looked at the Sodomas and Lorenzettis and Beccafumis. Then to the Duomo and home for lunch.In the afternoon we walked out to the Osservanti, where we saw lovely altar-piece by one of the Della Robbia, the Coronation of the Virgin with Saints. It was a lovely walk.In the evening we wrote our Lotto and read. I am reading the second volume of  Creighton .
