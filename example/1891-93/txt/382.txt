Monday March 27. 1893.
Duomo and Annunziata and Innocenti in the morning. Saw a Luca della Robbia in the Innocenti we had never studied before, a great beauty! Worked on Lotto.
Walked to San Miniato, and worked on Lotto again.Read aloud  Ghosts  (Ibsen) in the evening, while Bernhard looked at photographs.Christina calls him “The Law” or else “The Eternal Light”. He has been deliciously entertaining ever since she has been here. A third person often wakes up conversation. Two people alone tend to become quiet.
