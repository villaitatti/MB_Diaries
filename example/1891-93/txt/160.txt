circle of mountains and the sunny plain. How beautiful it was!! Bernhard thought of nothing all day but Giovanni, Martini, and Girolamo da Udine, and which, if any or  all  was or were Pellegrino di San Daniele - The problem remains unanswered!!
Thursday Nov. 5. ’91. Vienna. Hotel Tegetthof
We met the Costas on the train at 7.50 and came on to Vienna, reaching it at 9.30. The carriages were comfortable and the scenery marvellous, and we enjoyed ourselves very much.We read Villiers de l’Isle Adam’s “ Nouveau Monde” and Flaubert’s “ Trois Contes ”. Giovanni had sweets, which served to beguile the journey.
