Went to S. Maria del Pieve, the Duomo and the Pinacothek in the morning, and S. Francesco (Pier dei Franceschi frescoes) in the afternoon and a little walk to see the porch of S. Maria delle Grazie by Benedetto da Maiano. The architecture was just like Buonconsiglio’s, and  wonderfully  beautiful. The view of Arezzo through the arches was charming. This was a great pleasure, and it was a pleasure, too,
