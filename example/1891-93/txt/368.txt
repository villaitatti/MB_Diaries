Creighton’s History of the Papacy -a birthday present from mother, arrived, and Horatio  Browne’s [ sic ] “History of Venice .”The latter we began to read at once. We went to see the Pontormos in the Collegio Militare. I dined with the Carlisles. Lord Carlisle and Lady Mary’s husband, Mr. Murray, were particularly nice, although Lord Carlisle said that France had never produced a great man and that there was no such thing as painting now in Paris! It seemed awful to me to be living in such a rabble. Lady Carlisle ordering them all about, and fighting with her husband. O the joys of solitude!!Mr. Murray came back with me and came in to look at Perry’s History of Greek Literature.
