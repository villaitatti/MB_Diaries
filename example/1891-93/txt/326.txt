x  Tuesday Nov. 8. 1892. Todi
Bernhard’s long desire is accomplished - we have seen the Church at Todi. To our surprise, Todi itself turns out to be a more important town, with a fine gothic cathedral, Renaissance palaces, a well-preserved side of a Roman Basilica, etc.The hotel is impossible, but the Restaurant (del Teatro) is good, and they found us sleeping places in a palace close by S. Fortunato. We drove here, starting on 8 and reaching here at 1.30. We “did” Diruta on the way, finding a  Fiorenzo  and an Eusebio. We spent all the afternoon in and around the glorious church….

It was one of the Great Experiences of our lives. Drive 25 francs.
Wednesday Nov. 9. 1892. Belle Arti. Perugia
We saw Todi in the morning - all too hurriedly, and started at 12.Stopped at S. M. di Consolazione again of course- and also saw another fine church, from 1591 outside another gate.Reached here about 5.30 and dined at the  Progresso , which seems rather nicer than this place. Wrote letters, but were rather tired and sleepy.
