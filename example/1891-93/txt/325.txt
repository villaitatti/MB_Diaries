del Calcinaio. Even a short glimpse was a never-to-be-forgotten experience.We reached Perugia at 11 and after lunch I had my first glimpse of the Gallery - Then I came back and finished and sent off my Womanâ€™s Herald article on  The March of Ancona , while Bernhard stayed for further study.We went to the Piazza and saw the sunset, and then went into the Duomo.Afterwards we hunted all over the town for a bookshop, and found  only one  and a very poor one. The Library moreover is open only in the morning!!

Bernhard wants me to write what I have just said - that I will always love him as much as I do now, and always want as much to be with him.
We went to San Pietro in the morning, and the Gallery, San Severo, S. Bernardino, etc., in the afternoon. Enjoyed the Oratory of La Chiesa Nuova.
