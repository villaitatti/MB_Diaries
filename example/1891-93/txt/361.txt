as it were, on my birthday, and invite us to dinner.We finished and sent off a review of Brownell’s book, which, at the moment, in the first glow of composition, I think was a pretty good review. I hope Alys can get it in somewhere.We dined with Loeser. Looked over his fine collection of Michelangelo drawings. He says that Mrs. James wept the other day when her husband brought home some of his pictures in which he had been spending the money they need for other things, and that James, in irritation, ran his knife through them then and there.The Ways went to the Corsini Ball, Mrs. Way getting a new dress for 400 francs. They met  pension acquaintances  and no one else there, and were ill the next day - Mrs. Way in fact being again seriously ill in bed. And they have no money to pay for the dress. Yet they are upborne by the feeling that she was “the best dressed woman there.” Loeser thinks, however, that Mrs. Way would have been something splendid if she had married a man of more character.
