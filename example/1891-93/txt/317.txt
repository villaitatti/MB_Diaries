Friday Oct. 21. 1892. Ancona.
The heavens were opened, but we swam up to S. Domenico and had an hour and a half over the glorious Titian there. Then we had an hour in the Pinacoteca. After lunch I finished my article for “The Women’s Herald”-Bernhard went to the Duomo. I went later, when I had finished my writing, thinking I might join him there, but we missed. Hence a dreadful quarrel, which made us both unhappy.
