 Thursday Feb. 25. 1892.
Saw the Andrea del Sarto frescoes at the Annunziata, the Scalzo, San Salvi and the Academy.I paid a short call on Gertrude.After my Italian lesson I went to B.’s where I had tea and read Huysmans’ wonderful little story called “ Un Dilemme ”. We walked and in the evening I read my children’s story to B. I have decided to call it  Linden Stories  or  Summers at Linden . He was very enthusiastic, to my great delight. How I hope it may turn out to be worth while. I would like to support myself.

I went to the tomb of the Medici in the morning.Gertrude gave me her criticisms on our Correggio article, which she seemed to think very important, but I did not find them worth much.After my lesson we walked nearly to the Villa Careggi.Then came home and had tea.B. read Creighton’s  History of the Papacy and I finished the first part of my  Linden Stories .  B. thought it good.After he went, I read some of Creighton too.
