 Hotel Roth. Munich. Friday September 4. 91.
Went to gallery in morning and looked over the drawings. The only ones of note were the  Fra Bartolommeos  (especially a Head of a Woman),  Mantegna , Madonna with an angel on each side;  Sodoma , Virtues driving out Vices (analogous to Mantegna’s picture in the Louvre); some small Cupid pictures by Penni; a  Mantegna , and a much destroyed  Pollaijuolo . Afterwards we studied the Italian pictures. B. disagrees with Morelli on several points: 1. That the so-called “Lionardo” is not Flemish but Italian, possibly an early Verrocchio. 2. That the so-called Luini is not a Solario. 3. That the Paris Bordone Portrait is not much repainted. 4.
