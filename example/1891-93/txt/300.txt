Wednesday Sept. 21. 1892. Bergamo
Saw the Picinelli collection in the morning. Madame Picinelli was charmingly affable, such a lovely house, such pictures, her children, her own two nice daughters, money, respectability - I was tempted to envy her, but was saved by that spirit in us which makes us reason things about till we become equal to anyone.
Then we went to San Spirito, and after lunch to the Gallery where we wrote a good deal of our article on the Morelli Collection.In the evening we wrote and Bernhard finished “ Les Liaisons dangereuses”  and I read Mrs. Creighton’s  Sir Walter Raleigh.
