tête-à-tête.
*  Paris. Monday. June 13. 1892.
I went to see Carey Thomas, and then we met at the New Salon. In the afternoon we met Maude and went through Durand-Ruel’s astonishing private collection of pictures by Manet, Monet, Pissaro, [ sic ] Sisley, etc. The Manet dancing scene was especially wonderful.Maude came to spend the night.
