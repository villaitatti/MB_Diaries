 Thursday. Dec. 1. 1892. Florence
I read “ The Pretenders” and saw a good deal in it.Met Costa and saw the Ghiberti, Donatellos, and Lucca della Robbias of the Duomo and then went to the Riccardi Palace to see the Benozzos.In the afternoon and evening,  unthed  over my article on Potapenko, while Bernhard enjoy[ed] himself reading magazines.
x  Friday. Dec. 2. 1892 Florence
Wrote, and Bernhard  unthed  with me. The ideas of the darned article are “ stupendo ”, but they aren’t said clearly or nicely - We went to the Bargello and enjoyed ourselves.Bernhard walked in the Cascine, and Costa came to call, and again was very nice. Type-wrote the article, such as it is.Bernhard gave birth to several ideas - such as the Law of Popularity for books - and the law of their  living . The former is a book that describes the contemporary phase of the struggle for existence, the latter book that  adds to the world’s capital . Of course they may go together.
