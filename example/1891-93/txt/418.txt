dreadful time finding rooms- for the town is crowded, and has been since June 4, with a Fair. One hotel keeper said he could not give us 3 single rooms, but he could give us one room with 3 beds! That man deserves to succeed in his business!!!
Sunday Sept. 10. 1893. * Hotel dâ€™Ampezzo Toblach
Saw the Gallery, etc. - came here.
Monday Sept. 11. 1893. * Aquila Nera. Cortina
Diligence to Schluderbach - Then we walked through the Dolomites here, about 15/16 miles. We enjoyed every step of the way, all three of us. It was a thoroughly delightful day.
Tuesday Sept. 12. 1893. Hotel Venezia. Pieve di Cadore
Diligence to Barca - walked to Venas. There I took the post here, but Hapgood and Berenson walked. I went to another hotel from the one arranged, and failed to catch them on the way, so they had a tiresome hunt. Bernhard was very cross.Saw the Church, etc.
