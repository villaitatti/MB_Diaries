*  Saturday May 27. 1893. Bergamo
Started in the train at 6.10 for Celana, and after a delightful walk through country more exhilarating and dewy than Switzerland itself, found our Lotto. We spent three hours enjoying it. Wrote and Bernhard called on Signor Piccinelli while I met the Mikes in the afternoon.
Sunday May 28. 93. Bergamo
Took the Mikes to the Gallery in the morning and to the Piccinelliâ€™s in the afternoon. Wrote.
Monday May 29. 93. Bergamo
Lotto intarsias - churches.Went with Signor Piccinelli to see the Roncagli picture - where I discovered a Bartolomeo Veneto! And to the Moroni collection. The Bergamo bells are excruciating. We all feel as if the grey matter of our brains was being beaten to a froth like white of egg.
Tuesday May 30. 93. Bella Venezia. Milan
The Church Bells drove us away from Bergamo this evening as if we had been the veritable devils which they were delighted to drive away! In the morning Bernhard and I went to Grumello and drove along vine-scented lanes to three little towns near. We enjoyed every moment. We saw, besides the ruined Lotto we came in quest of, a splendid Romanino fresco.We saw the Intarsias before starting.Bernhard said one of his best things - that old people take new ideas like medicine, young people take them like food.
