 Sunday Feb. 12. 1893.  Florence
Worked on Lotto - went to Bargello.Walked in Cascine with Loeser in the afternoon and got caught in the rain.I was locked out all day, but went to Bernhard’s and while he read  Bosanquet I read a dozen  18th Century essays . Then I wrote to Lady Eastlake and he wrote to Went. The Women’s Herald with the Ibsen article came.

Lotto - went to Uffizi and San Martino – Walked -Read  Symonds  and  Eastlake  and  Ranke .Quarrelled out of mere silliness.
*  Tuesday Feb. 14. 1893. My 29th birthday
Bernhard brought me a bunch of daffodils as a token of reconciliation.Mr. Jenkins, whom we met at lunch, sent me an endless quantity of lovely violets. Ray sent me Valentines she had painted herself, and Alys sent me a book called  French Art  by one  Brownell ,which Bernhard and I both read the same day, with mixed emotions, mostly disgust.
