 Saturday Oct. 15. 1892. Hotel Masini. Forlì
Went to S. Giovanni Evangelista, S. Ap[ollinare] Nuovo, S. Maria in Porto (beautiful Renaissance architecture), S. Agatha, S. Francesco, Dante’s Tomb and Santo Spirito in the morning. In the afternoon went to S. Domenico, S. Vitale, and the Tomb of Galla Placidia in the afternoon. What wonderful mosaics in her tomb - what decoration, what sense of colour, what drawing, what appropriateness! We were enchanted.Then at 4.40 we came to Forlì by steam tram reaching here at 6.30. Found in my dressing table a paper written in English, “ Look out for yourself tonight, Sherlock Holmes ”, but after enquiry of the hotel people decided that it must be a “drummer’s” practical joke. Perhaps, however, it meant the fleas, which are hopping about the beds. I caught two on me when I undressed. I am literally eaten alive, and  nothing  does any good. I am saturated with the camphor which is sewed all over my clothes, and the fleas seem to like me the more - even though I bathe in camphorated water every day!!
