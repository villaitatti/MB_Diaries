pleasure to the members thereof? No, of course the family was the best thing for its time, but now it is obsolete and so a terrible chain. We all tried to think last night of a single case in which the family experiment had turned out happily. We could not think of one. Miss Bradley said that if she were young she would not  dare  to marry, that she could not take it upon her conscience to found a thing she so thoroughly disapproved of. Edith we called “Liberanda”, because she is going to try to throw off her father’s yoke a little.Hapgood is as much oppressed as any woman. He has plenty of money, but his parents insist upon his going into a lawyer’s office in Chicago. He has grown apathetic from living too long in Cambridge. He says he knows it isn’t life, but he prefers Cambridge. Silly child!!
