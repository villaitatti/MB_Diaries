For a few days I forgot to keep a record - but the programme was nearly always the same - pictures, lunch, a rest, and Burke and Maude in the evening. Burke took us again to “Les Troyens”which we enjoyed even more than before. Bernhard developed his “Law of  Schock .”

We spent the day with Mr. Burke and his friend Mr. Irwick, first at the New Salon and then at the two Duran-Ruel’s collections. Bôcher was with us.The “Mikes” arrived in the evening, to stay with me, and after dinner came a dreadful letter from mother, urging me to go home and work for Frank’s election - !! It nearly broke my heart.
