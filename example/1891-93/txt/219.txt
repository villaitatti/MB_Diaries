made B. so angry that he went away in a rage.I went with the others to the Martelli collection and saw a young Velasquez (according to Richter), the head of a man with a grey beard and red cap, and 2 Beccafumis, Luper [cali] feasts. Besides this, a Donatello heraldic beast in gold on the stair-case, a St. John and the head of a little St. John, and a David which shows clearly where Michelangelo got his inspiration.
After lunch I went with the children to a Washington’s Birthday party which Gertrude gave, a very pretty, dainty little affair, which made a deep impression upon the children.Then I wrote my Cedars story till B. came.The evening was sacrificed to a discussion of the quarrel of the morning. B. found me very unsympathetic and insensitive. So I was, I think. My brain felt quite numb. I hope he will not often get so angry with people. Whether they deserve it or not, it doesn’t pay. He determined to drop Loeser, and in that I think he is wise, for Loeser is a simply awful bore. But it would be a mistake to quarrel open with him. Well - it was all rather a bore, yes, a decided bore.
