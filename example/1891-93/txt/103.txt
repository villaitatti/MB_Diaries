 Goldner Kreuz Ratisbon Wednesday. Sept.  2. 1891.
Breakfast of grapes and coffee in our sunny bay-window. Went forth to view the town. Were delighted with the quaint portal of the Romanesque Irish Church of XII Century, Die Schottenkirche - Strolled along the Boulevard in Park on old town wall, and came to the Cathedral. Went inside - good proportions, light and gay, with beautiful stained glass. Lets in the real god - the Sun. We saw the treasures â€“ 
Hair of Blessed Virgin 
Spike from Crown of Thorns 
Several inches of wood from True Cross 
(set in gold and jewels, which having been pawned to the Jews of Regensburg, was seized from them and deposited there), 
Brown mummified hand of S. Chrysostom with diamond ring;
