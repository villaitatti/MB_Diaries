instinct almost as imperative as hunger, except that I  can  control it.But I do love her so. If she could only know how I prize every hair of her head and every inch of her skin, particularly where her dear little bones peep all through the thinness! But perhaps she would not, if she knew, care much for that kind of love, and she would be right, for it is not personal. Still, it would lead me to do anything I could for her, except give up my own personality and my own chances, or to harm Bernhard in any way. But I do love her so! My heart aches so for the sight of her, and the feel of her.
I was wrong when I said we worked on Lotto all day. We spent the morning answering Stillman, and I think our answer was really crushing. We said that the error confusing Domenico and Jacopo Tintoretto showed that a man was about as fit for writing of Italian art as a man who mixed up Julian and Nathaniel Hawthorne would be for writing about American literature!!
