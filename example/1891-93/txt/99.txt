An old inn. Delightfully large room.
Pleasant journey from Dresden, 8.45 to 5.45.Finished Goncourt’s Journal, read Pierre Loti’s “ Le Livre de Pitié et de la Mort ,”et Villier de Lisle Adam’s “ Histoires insolites . ”Studied German. Read Charles V . Reached Ratisbon in time for a sunset on bridge over the Danube. Saw Cathedral, which had resemblances to Notre Dame de Paris. Late Gothic but on the whole good - for Gothic!
