It made me sad.\nMiss Cooke and Mrs. Clarke, whom I took around the gallery on Sunday, were very much struck by the likeness of the youngest man in Giorgione\u2019s  Three Astrologers  to Bernhard, and also by certain nuances of likeness in the  St. Sebastian  attributed to Correggio. It is very curious. Giorgione\u2019s  Shepherd  at Hampton Court looked so like him, and the young man in the  Three Ages , and the Portrait by Botticelli in the Louvre. Miss Cooke\u2019s \u201cfavourites\u201d are the St. Sebastian and \u201cdas grosse Eccehomobild\u201d by Titian. Mrs. Clarke liked Correggio\u2019s  Ganymede  best.\nI took tea with Janet. She is in a curious state of mind. She is naturally an intellectual but she has tried too much to squeeze \n[165 ter]\nherself into a moral mould, and the result is a painful contortion, and she doesn\u2019t know where she is. She is shocking by dependence. She wants some one to tell her what to think, but when they tell her, she grows stiff and angry if the thoughts don\u2019t fit into her perfectly narrow and impossible moral mould. So she is unhappy and undecided, enjoying nothing, useless, except as her husband\u2019s \u201c helpmeet \u201d. Her sister who is here is in love with a man younger than herself, and Janet was in a rage over it. She thought it so \u201clow\u201d and \u201cdegrading\u201d and utterly incomprehensible, not \u201cideal\u201d in it.\nWomen, women? Why shouldn\u2019t a woman love a man younger than herself? Janet\u2019s remark was so characteristic. \u201cI can easily imagine falling in love with a man 50 years old. He would represent all my ideals.\u201d \u201cFalling in love with your head\u201d, I replied, and it made her angry, I fear.\nIn the evening we read Ibsen\u2019s  Fest auf Solhaug .",

But to make up for all, we came at the end upon a wonderful little chapel, the private chapel of Eleanora of Toledo, decorated with marvellous frescoes by Bronzino. One of them, the drowning Pharaoh\u2019s army in the Red Sea, had as wonderful a stretch of sunset coloured water as even Besnard could have painted! It reminded us both of Besnard. The figures, too were drawn with his delicious precision, that gives one such a sense of  completeness . There is no hesitation, nothing tentative about him. What he undertakes to do, he carries through perfectly\u2026Then we went to the Badia, and then to the Uffizi, where we met Costa, with whom we walked back.I had an Italian lesson.Then the little Foote boy, and Arnold and Harold and Yvonne came, so that there was a merry party of children.Then I went to B.\u2019s where we had tea with Mr. and Mrs. Adams and Mr. Jenkins.

All this time we were rather quarrel-y.B. came to tea.In the evening we talked over what I had written. He was very nice. He promised to do the Hampton Court Guide for me. He said my feeling so, was about as silly as if he should fall into utter discouragement because I failed to get up much interest in the Florentines. The parallel was too good for me to deny."

One story, \u201cFaint Heart\u201d struck me as good. But the printed novel was Trash, and the historical essay poor to the last degree. It was an example of how a person acquires a reputation for learning by making a bad hash of a dozen (in her case it was about 3) good books. I supposed it made an impression on her relative because of the Mesopotamia sound of \u201cLorenzo\u201d and \u201cthe Renaissance\u201d. These words ring sweet in the ears of the semi-cultured, particularly in America. I wrote to her.\nMonday April 4. 1892. Florence\nMore Gertrude rubbish all day. I must say I take Miss Bliss\u2019 side, bad as she is. Gertrude is certainly responsible for a good deal of her badness. Karin was feverish, and I had to have Ray.

Paris\nI was unwell, but still we went to the Louvre about noon, and took notes on the remaining Florentines in the Gallerie de Sept M\u00e8tres.In the afternoon I read  La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle, and Bernhard read Monk Lewis, \u201c Rosario .\u201d Burke returned from Vienna and we dined with him.Read Creighton.\nSunday Sept. 4. 1892. Paris\nWent to the Louvre, and Bernhard\u2019s flock of myself, Burke, Hapgood and Jens Thiisgathered round him.We lunched together (all but Thiis) and then went to the Exposition des Arts de la Femme.

Lunched with Hapgood who came here and looked over the Lionardo book and talked.Then we drove with him in the Bois and Bernhard talked \u201cdoctrine\u201d which Hapgood drank in. He is astonishingly honest and free from vanity. We dined together. We discussed  genre  and came to the conclusion that the term has no meaning now. Bernhard compared the growth of Art to  hair.  It depends on the general state of the body (Society), yet has an independent growth from itself. It is a capital idea. I mean it clears up a great deal for me that had been confused.

In the afternoon I wrote to Mr. Arford, my solicitor, sending him some questions for Counsel\u2019s opinion.Then we went to the Palazzo Marcelli-Durazzo, and found nothing, but a fine stair-case and Guidos and Rubens, etc. Then to the Balbi-Senegara and found an overwhelming Titian - marvellously beautiful - worth any journey!Afterwards we saw the sunset from the town of S.

Bernhard wrote to Maude.\nWednesday Oct. 12. 1892.Venice\nGallery in morning and Doge\u2019s Palace in the afternoon.Bernhard sent off the frame to Burke after much trouble.I finished  Charles V .Packed and wrote in the evening.\nThursday Oct. 13. 92. Hotel San Marco. Ravenna\nArrived in Padua at 10. Saw Santa Giustina and the splendid Paolo, the Santo, and the Gallery. Then Bernhard discovered an Alvise Vivarini, and I a Licinio. He also found that Speranza\u2019s pictures (last year\u2019s attributions) were done by Filippo da Verona, a sad discovery! Then we went to the Arena and saw the Giottos and came in by the 3 o\u2019clock train, arriving at 7.30.I read Morley\u2019s  Diderot, written in a vulgar newspaper style, but very interesting.",

Francesco, Dante\u2019s Tomb and Santo Spirito in the morning. In the afternoon went to S. Domenico, S. Vitale, and the Tomb of Galla Placidia in the afternoon. What wonderful mosaics in her tomb - what decoration, what sense of colour, what drawing, what appropriateness! We were enchanted.Then at 4.40 we came to Forl\u00ec by steam tram reaching here at 6.30. Found in my dressing table a paper written in English, \u201c Look out for yourself tonight, Sherlock Holmes \u201d, but after enquiry of the hotel people decided that it must be a \u201cdrummer\u2019s\u201d practical joke. Perhaps, however, it meant the fleas, which are hopping about the beds. I caught two on me when I undressed. I am literally eaten alive, and  nothing  does any good.

It was almost hidden by a wooden case, but we climbed up and saw what we could, and that little looked like  Melozzo . This disconcerted him, as he has prepared a history of the Church which is all ready to be printed - except for the author of the picture. He came to see us off at the Station and presented us with a book he wrote to refute somebody who dared to deny that Tasso ever submitted his \u201cGerusalemme Liberata\u201d to the Macerata Academy.We arrived here in a perfect evening, with bright moonlight.

It had to be domed, because, as I have tried to show, the perfection of space is attainable only the meeting of four arms under a dome. The arms are the arches I have been speaking of all the time.

No arm could be longer; in other words, no arch deeper.\n\u2026 I have copied the rest of this elsewhere so I will not go on.

On the way we stopped to see the * Villa Lante at Bagnaia (4 kilometres from Viterbo) The architecture was most interesting, being a cross between the Farnesina and the Palazzo del T\u00e8 - perhaps Raphael, or Giulio Romano young - or could it have been Vignola? Whoever it was, it was very fine. Hundreds of fountains and running streams splashed about. The basins and urns and terraces, etc., were all fine and strong, evidently the work of a great artist.Then we stopped to see the Madonna della Quercia - (of 1538, Paul III) with its fine Bramante tower, and early Renaissance interior, and two most interesting cloisters. In the afternoon looked at the Sebastiano del Piombo in the Pinacoteca and saw the Duomo, etc. Found a really good restaurant - the Schenardi. Quarrelled.\nWednesday Nov. 16. 1892. Grandori.

I do not feel particularly angry, but I  must  find a way of preventing his using that brutal tone towards me without regret. He said he did not know what it was to apologize, and that being so, he must learn not to indulge in outbreaks of temper which require apology - Of course I know a momentary fit of temper isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, but it is only too easy for men to excuse themselves for such brutalities, and Bernhard is no exception.
